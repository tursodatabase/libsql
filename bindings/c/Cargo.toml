# The produced binaries are too large for mobiles
# When compiling for iOS or Android, you should turn on symbol stripping, lto and cut debug symbols
# [profile.release]
# debug = false # Exclude debug symbols
# strip = "symbols" # Exclude the rest of the symbols
# # opt-level = "z" # Did not use this, but it equals C++'s optimize for size (O3?)
# lto = true # Link time optimization, not sure what this does but it helps reduce the size
