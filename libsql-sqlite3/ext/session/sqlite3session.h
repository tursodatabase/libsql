** <h3>Special sqlite_stat1 Handling</h3>
**
** As of SQLite version 3.22.0, the "sqlite_stat1" table is an exception to 
** some of the rules above. In SQLite, the schema of sqlite_stat1 is:
**  <pre>
**  &nbsp;     CREATE TABLE sqlite_stat1(tbl,idx,stat)  
**  </pre>
**
** Even though sqlite_stat1 does not have a PRIMARY KEY, changes are 
** recorded for it as if the PRIMARY KEY is (tbl,idx). Additionally, changes 
** are recorded for rows for which (idx IS NULL) is true. However, for such
** rows a zero-length blob (SQL value X'') is stored in the changeset or
** patchset instead of a NULL value. This allows such changesets to be
** manipulated by legacy implementations of sqlite3changeset_invert(),
** concat() and similar.
**
** The sqlite3changeset_apply() function automatically converts the 
** zero-length blob back to a NULL value when updating the sqlite_stat1
** table. However, if the application calls sqlite3changeset_new(),
** sqlite3changeset_old() or sqlite3changeset_conflict on a changeset 
** iterator directly (including on a changeset iterator passed to a
** conflict-handler callback) then the X'' value is returned. The application
** must translate X'' to NULL itself if required.
**
** Legacy (older than 3.22.0) versions of the sessions module cannot capture
** changes made to the sqlite_stat1 table. Legacy versions of the
** sqlite3changeset_apply() function silently ignore any modifications to the
** sqlite_stat1 table that are part of a changeset or patchset.

** CAPI3REF: Generate A Changeset From A Session Object
** METHOD: sqlite3_session
**
** Obtain a changeset containing changes to the tables attached to the 
** session object passed as the first argument. If successful, 
** set *ppChangeset to point to a buffer containing the changeset 
** and *pnChangeset to the size of the changeset in bytes before returning
** SQLITE_OK. If an error occurs, set both *ppChangeset and *pnChangeset to
** zero and return an SQLite error code.
**
** A changeset consists of zero or more INSERT, UPDATE and/or DELETE changes,
** each representing a change to a single row of an attached table. An INSERT
** change contains the values of each field of a new database row. A DELETE
** contains the original values of each field of a deleted database row. An
** UPDATE change contains the original values of each field of an updated
** database row along with the updated values for each updated non-primary-key
** column. It is not possible for an UPDATE change to represent a change that
** modifies the values of primary key columns. If such a change is made, it
** is represented in a changeset as a DELETE followed by an INSERT.
**
** Changes are not recorded for rows that have NULL values stored in one or 
** more of their PRIMARY KEY columns. If such a row is inserted or deleted,
** no corresponding change is present in the changesets returned by this
** function. If an existing row with one or more NULL values stored in
** PRIMARY KEY columns is updated so that all PRIMARY KEY columns are non-NULL,
** only an INSERT is appears in the changeset. Similarly, if an existing row
** with non-NULL PRIMARY KEY values is updated so that one or more of its
** PRIMARY KEY columns are set to NULL, the resulting changeset contains a
** DELETE change only.
**
** The contents of a changeset may be traversed using an iterator created
** using the [sqlite3changeset_start()] API. A changeset may be applied to
** a database with a compatible schema using the [sqlite3changeset_apply()]
** API.
**
** Within a changeset generated by this function, all changes related to a
** single table are grouped together. In other words, when iterating through
** a changeset or when applying a changeset to a database, all changes related
** to a single table are processed before moving on to the next table. Tables
** are sorted in the same order in which they were attached (or auto-attached)
** to the sqlite3_session object. The order in which the changes related to
** a single table are stored is undefined.
**
** Following a successful call to this function, it is the responsibility of
** the caller to eventually free the buffer that *ppChangeset points to using
** [sqlite3_free()].
**
** <h3>Changeset Generation</h3>
**
** Once a table has been attached to a session object, the session object
** records the primary key values of all new rows inserted into the table.
** It also records the original primary key and other column values of any
** deleted or updated rows. For each unique primary key value, data is only
** recorded once - the first time a row with said primary key is inserted,
** updated or deleted in the lifetime of the session.
**
** There is one exception to the previous paragraph: when a row is inserted,
** updated or deleted, if one or more of its primary key columns contain a
** NULL value, no record of the change is made.
**
** The session object therefore accumulates two types of records - those
** that consist of primary key values only (created when the user inserts
** a new record) and those that consist of the primary key values and the
** original values of other table columns (created when the users deletes
** or updates a record).
**
** When this function is called, the requested changeset is created using
** both the accumulated records and the current contents of the database
** file. Specifically:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> For each record generated by an insert, the database is queried
**        for a row with a matching primary key. If one is found, an INSERT
**        change is added to the changeset. If no such row is found, no change 
**        is added to the changeset.
**
**   <li> For each record generated by an update or delete, the database is 
**        queried for a row with a matching primary key. If such a row is
**        found and one or more of the non-primary key fields have been
**        modified from their original values, an UPDATE change is added to 
**        the changeset. Or, if no such row is found in the table, a DELETE 
**        change is added to the changeset. If there is a row with a matching
**        primary key in the database, but all fields contain their original
**        values, no change is added to the changeset.
** </ul>
**
** This means, amongst other things, that if a row is inserted and then later
** deleted while a session object is active, neither the insert nor the delete
** will be present in the changeset. Or if a row is deleted and then later a 
** row with the same primary key values inserted while a session object is
** active, the resulting changeset will contain an UPDATE change instead of
** a DELETE and an INSERT.
**
** When a session object is disabled (see the [sqlite3session_enable()] API),
** it does not accumulate records when rows are inserted, updated or deleted.
** This may appear to have some counter-intuitive effects if a single row
** is written to more than once during a session. For example, if a row
** is inserted while a session object is enabled, then later deleted while 
** the same session object is disabled, no INSERT record will appear in the
** changeset, even though the delete took place while the session was disabled.
** Or, if one field of a row is updated while a session is disabled, and 
** another field of the same row is updated while the session is enabled, the
** resulting changeset will contain an UPDATE change that updates both fields.

**
** Argument zFromDb must be the name of a database ("main", "temp" etc.)

**
** <ul>
**   <li> Has the same name,
**   <li> Has the same set of columns declared in the same order, and
**   <li> Has the same PRIMARY KEY definition.
** </ul>
**
** If the tables are not compatible, SQLITE_SCHEMA is returned. If the tables
** are compatible but do not have any PRIMARY KEY columns, it is not an error
** but no changes are added to the session object. As with other session

** used to update the table in database zFrom (call this the "from-table") 
** so that its content is the same as the table attached to the session 
** object (call this the "to-table"). Specifically:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> For each row (primary key) that exists in the to-table but not in 
**     the from-table, an INSERT record is added to the session object.
**
**   <li> For each row (primary key) that exists in the to-table but not in 
**     the from-table, a DELETE record is added to the session object.

**   <li> For each row (primary key) that exists in both tables, but features 
**     different non-PK values in each, an UPDATE record is added to the
**     session.

** Changes to rows that do not already appear in the changegroup are

** CAPI3REF: Apply A Changeset To A Database
**
** Apply a changeset or patchset to a database. These functions attempt to
** update the "main" database attached to handle db with the changes found in
** the changeset passed via the second and third arguments. 
**
** The fourth argument (xFilter) passed to these functions is the "filter
** callback". If it is not NULL, then for each table affected by at least one
** change in the changeset, the filter callback is invoked with
** the table name as the second argument, and a copy of the context pointer
** passed as the sixth argument as the first. If the "filter callback"
** returns zero, then no attempt is made to apply any changes to the table.
** Otherwise, if the return value is non-zero or the xFilter argument to
** is NULL, all changes related to the table are attempted.
**
** For each table that is not excluded by the filter callback, this function 
** tests that the target database contains a compatible table. A table is 
** considered compatible if all of the following are true:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> The table has the same name as the name recorded in the 
**        changeset, and
**   <li> The table has at least as many columns as recorded in the 
**        changeset, and
**   <li> The table has primary key columns in the same position as 
**        recorded in the changeset.
** </ul>
**
** If there is no compatible table, it is not an error, but none of the
** changes associated with the table are applied. A warning message is issued
** via the sqlite3_log() mechanism with the error code SQLITE_SCHEMA. At most
** one such warning is issued for each table in the changeset.
**
** For each change for which there is a compatible table, an attempt is made 
** to modify the table contents according to the UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE 
** change. If a change cannot be applied cleanly, the conflict handler 
** function passed as the fifth argument to sqlite3changeset_apply() may be 
** invoked. A description of exactly when the conflict handler is invoked for 
** each type of change is below.
**
** Unlike the xFilter argument, xConflict may not be passed NULL. The results
** of passing anything other than a valid function pointer as the xConflict
** argument are undefined.
**
** Each time the conflict handler function is invoked, it must return one
** of [SQLITE_CHANGESET_OMIT], [SQLITE_CHANGESET_ABORT] or 
** [SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE]. SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE may only be returned
** if the second argument passed to the conflict handler is either
** SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA or SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICT. If the conflict-handler
** returns an illegal value, any changes already made are rolled back and
** the call to sqlite3changeset_apply() returns SQLITE_MISUSE. Different 
** actions are taken by sqlite3changeset_apply() depending on the value
** returned by each invocation of the conflict-handler function. Refer to
** the documentation for the three 
** [SQLITE_CHANGESET_OMIT|available return values] for details.
**
** <dl>
** <dt>DELETE Changes<dd>
**   For each DELETE change, the function checks if the target database 
**   contains a row with the same primary key value (or values) as the 
**   original row values stored in the changeset. If it does, and the values 
**   stored in all non-primary key columns also match the values stored in 
**   the changeset the row is deleted from the target database.
**
**   If a row with matching primary key values is found, but one or more of
**   the non-primary key fields contains a value different from the original
**   row value stored in the changeset, the conflict-handler function is
**   invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA] as the second argument. If the
**   database table has more columns than are recorded in the changeset,
**   only the values of those non-primary key fields are compared against
**   the current database contents - any trailing database table columns
**   are ignored.
**
**   If no row with matching primary key values is found in the database,
**   the conflict-handler function is invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_NOTFOUND]
**   passed as the second argument.
**
**   If the DELETE operation is attempted, but SQLite returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT
**   (which can only happen if a foreign key constraint is violated), the
**   conflict-handler function is invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT]
**   passed as the second argument. This includes the case where the DELETE
**   operation is attempted because an earlier call to the conflict handler
**   function returned [SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE].
**
** <dt>INSERT Changes<dd>
**   For each INSERT change, an attempt is made to insert the new row into
**   the database. If the changeset row contains fewer fields than the
**   database table, the trailing fields are populated with their default
**   values.
**
**   If the attempt to insert the row fails because the database already 
**   contains a row with the same primary key values, the conflict handler
**   function is invoked with the second argument set to 
**   [SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICT].
**
**   If the attempt to insert the row fails because of some other constraint
**   violation (e.g. NOT NULL or UNIQUE), the conflict handler function is 
**   invoked with the second argument set to [SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT].
**   This includes the case where the INSERT operation is re-attempted because 
**   an earlier call to the conflict handler function returned 
**   [SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE].
**
** <dt>UPDATE Changes<dd>
**   For each UPDATE change, the function checks if the target database 
**   contains a row with the same primary key value (or values) as the 
**   original row values stored in the changeset. If it does, and the values 
**   stored in all modified non-primary key columns also match the values

**   If a row with matching primary key values is found, but one or more of
**   the modified non-primary key fields contains a value different from an
**   original row value stored in the changeset, the conflict-handler function
**   is invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA] as the second argument. Since
**   UPDATE changes only contain values for non-primary key fields that are
**   to be modified, only those fields need to match the original values to
**   avoid the SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA conflict-handler callback.
**
**   If no row with matching primary key values is found in the database,
**   the conflict-handler function is invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_NOTFOUND]
**   passed as the second argument.
**
**   If the UPDATE operation is attempted, but SQLite returns 
**   SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, the conflict-handler function is invoked with 
**   [SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT] passed as the second argument.
**   This includes the case where the UPDATE operation is attempted after 
**   an earlier call to the conflict handler function returned
**   [SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE].

** It is safe to execute SQL statements, including those that write to the

** This can be used to further customize the application's conflict
** resolution strategy.
**
** All changes made by these functions are enclosed in a savepoint transaction.
** If any other error (aside from a constraint failure when attempting to
** write to the target database) occurs, then the savepoint transaction is

** SQLite error code returned.
**
** If the output parameters (ppRebase) and (pnRebase) are non-NULL and

** <dl>
** <dt>SQLITE_CHANGESETAPPLY_NOSAVEPOINT <dd>
**   Usually, the sessions module encloses all operations performed by
**   a single call to apply_v2() or apply_v2_strm() in a [SAVEPOINT]. The
**   SAVEPOINT is committed if the changeset or patchset is successfully
**   applied, or rolled back if an error occurs. Specifying this flag
**   causes the sessions module to omit this savepoint. In this case, if the
**   caller has an open transaction or savepoint when apply_v2() is called, 
**   it may revert the partially applied changeset by rolling it back.
**
** <dt>SQLITE_CHANGESETAPPLY_INVERT <dd>
**   Invert the changeset before applying it. This is equivalent to inverting
**   a changeset using sqlite3changeset_invert() before applying it. It is
**   an error to specify this flag with a patchset.
**
** <dt>SQLITE_CHANGESETAPPLY_IGNORENOOP <dd>
**   Do not invoke the conflict handler callback for any changes that
**   would not actually modify the database even if they were applied.
**   Specifically, this means that the conflict handler is not invoked
**   for:
**    <ul>
**    <li>a delete change if the row being deleted cannot be found, 
**    <li>an update change if the modified fields are already set to 
**        their new values in the conflicting row, or
**    <li>an insert change if all fields of the conflicting row match
**        the row being inserted.
**    </ul>
**
** <dt>SQLITE_CHANGESETAPPLY_FKNOACTION <dd>
**   If this flag it set, then all foreign key constraints in the target

** <dt>SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICT<dd>
**   CHANGESET_CONFLICT is passed as the second argument to the conflict
**   handler while processing an INSERT change if the operation would result 
**   in duplicate primary key values.
** 
**   The conflicting row in this case is the database row with the matching
**   primary key.
**
** <dt>SQLITE_CHANGESET_FOREIGN_KEY<dd>

/* 
** CAPI3REF: Rebasing changesets
** EXPERIMENTAL
**
** Suppose there is a site hosting a database in state S0. And that
** modifications are made that move that database to state S1 and a
** changeset recorded (the "local" changeset). Then, a changeset based
** on S0 is received from another site (the "remote" changeset) and 
** applied to the database. The database is then in state 
** (S1+"remote"), where the exact state depends on any conflict
** resolution decisions (OMIT or REPLACE) made while applying "remote".
** Rebasing a changeset is to update it to take those conflict 
** resolution decisions into account, so that the same conflicts
** do not have to be resolved elsewhere in the network. 
**
** For example, if both the local and remote changesets contain an
** INSERT of the same key on "CREATE TABLE t1(a PRIMARY KEY, b)":
**
**   local:  INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 'v1');
**   remote: INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 'v2');
**
** and the conflict resolution is REPLACE, then the INSERT change is
** removed from the local changeset (it was overridden). Or, if the
** conflict resolution was "OMIT", then the local changeset is modified
** to instead contain:
**
**           UPDATE t1 SET b = 'v2' WHERE a=1;
**
** Changes within the local changeset are rebased as follows:
**
** <dl>
** <dt>Local INSERT<dd>
**   This may only conflict with a remote INSERT. If the conflict 
**   resolution was OMIT, then add an UPDATE change to the rebased
**   changeset. Or, if the conflict resolution was REPLACE, add
**   nothing to the rebased changeset.
**
** <dt>Local DELETE<dd>
**   This may conflict with a remote UPDATE or DELETE. In both cases the
**   only possible resolution is OMIT. If the remote operation was a
**   DELETE, then add no change to the rebased changeset. If the remote
**   operation was an UPDATE, then the old.* fields of change are updated
**   to reflect the new.* values in the UPDATE.
**
** <dt>Local UPDATE<dd>
**   This may conflict with a remote UPDATE or DELETE. If it conflicts
**   with a DELETE, and the conflict resolution was OMIT, then the update
**   is changed into an INSERT. Any undefined values in the new.* record
**   from the update change are filled in using the old.* values from
**   the conflicting DELETE. Or, if the conflict resolution was REPLACE,
**   the UPDATE change is simply omitted from the rebased changeset.
**
**   If conflict is with a remote UPDATE and the resolution is OMIT, then
**   the old.* values are rebased using the new.* values in the remote
**   change. Or, if the resolution is REPLACE, then the change is copied
**   into the rebased changeset with updates to columns also updated by
**   the conflicting remote UPDATE removed. If this means no columns would 
**   be updated, the change is omitted.
** </dl>
**
** A local change may be rebased against multiple remote changes 
** simultaneously. If a single key is modified by multiple remote 
** changesets, they are combined as follows before the local changeset
** is rebased:
**
** <ul>
**    <li> If there has been one or more REPLACE resolutions on a
**         key, it is rebased according to a REPLACE.
**
**    <li> If there have been no REPLACE resolutions on a key, then
**         the local changeset is rebased according to the most recent
**         of the OMIT resolutions.
** </ul>
**
** Note that conflict resolutions from multiple remote changesets are 
** combined on a per-field basis, not per-row. This means that in the 
** case of multiple remote UPDATE operations, some fields of a single 
** local change may be rebased for REPLACE while others are rebased for 
** OMIT.
**
** In order to rebase a local changeset, the remote changeset must first
** be applied to the local database using sqlite3changeset_apply_v2() and
** the buffer of rebase information captured. Then:
**
** <ol>
**   <li> An sqlite3_rebaser object is created by calling 
**        sqlite3rebaser_create().
**   <li> The new object is configured with the rebase buffer obtained from
**        sqlite3changeset_apply_v2() by calling sqlite3rebaser_configure().
**        If the local changeset is to be rebased against multiple remote
**        changesets, then sqlite3rebaser_configure() should be called
**        multiple times, in the same order that the multiple
**        sqlite3changeset_apply_v2() calls were made.
**   <li> Each local changeset is rebased by calling sqlite3rebaser_rebase().

**   <tr><td>sqlite3session_patchset_strm<td>[sqlite3session_patchset] 
** </table>
**
** Non-streaming functions that accept changesets (or patchsets) as input
** require that the entire changeset be stored in a single buffer in memory. 
** Similarly, those that return a changeset or patchset do so by returning 
** a pointer to a single large buffer allocated using sqlite3_malloc(). 
** Normally this is convenient. However, if an application running in a 
** low-memory environment is required to handle very large changesets, the
** large contiguous memory allocations required can become onerous.
**
** In order to avoid this problem, instead of a single large buffer, input
** is passed to a streaming API functions by way of a callback function that
** the sessions module invokes to incrementally request input data as it is
** required. In all cases, a pair of API function parameters such as
**
**  <pre>
**  &nbsp;     int nChangeset,
**  &nbsp;     void *pChangeset,
**  </pre>
**
** Is replaced by:
**
**  <pre>
**  &nbsp;     int (*xInput)(void *pIn, void *pData, int *pnData),
**  &nbsp;     void *pIn,
**  </pre>
**
** Each time the xInput callback is invoked by the sessions module, the first
** argument passed is a copy of the supplied pIn context pointer. The second 
** argument, pData, points to a buffer (*pnData) bytes in size. Assuming no 
** error occurs the xInput method should copy up to (*pnData) bytes of data 
** into the buffer and set (*pnData) to the actual number of bytes copied 
** before returning SQLITE_OK. If the input is completely exhausted, (*pnData) 
** should be set to zero to indicate this. Or, if an error occurs, an SQLite 
** error code should be returned. In all cases, if an xInput callback returns
** an error, all processing is abandoned and the streaming API function
** returns a copy of the error code to the caller.
**
** In the case of sqlite3changeset_start_strm(), the xInput callback may be
** invoked by the sessions module at any point during the lifetime of the
** iterator. If such an xInput callback returns an error, the iterator enters
** an error state, whereby all subsequent calls to iterator functions 
** immediately fail with the same error code as returned by xInput.
**
** Similarly, streaming API functions that return changesets (or patchsets)
** return them in chunks by way of a callback function instead of via a
** pointer to a single large buffer. In this case, a pair of parameters such
** as:
**
**  <pre>
**  &nbsp;     int *pnChangeset,
**  &nbsp;     void **ppChangeset,
**  </pre>
**
** Is replaced by:
**
**  <pre>
**  &nbsp;     int (*xOutput)(void *pOut, const void *pData, int nData),
**  &nbsp;     void *pOut
**  </pre>
**
** The xOutput callback is invoked zero or more times to return data to
** the application. The first parameter passed to each call is a copy of the
** pOut pointer supplied by the application. The second parameter, pData,
** points to a buffer nData bytes in size containing the chunk of output
** data being returned. If the xOutput callback successfully processes the
** supplied data, it should return SQLITE_OK to indicate success. Otherwise,
** it should return some other SQLite error code. In this case processing
** is immediately abandoned and the streaming API function returns a copy
** of the xOutput error code to the application.
**
** The sessions module never invokes an xOutput callback with the third 
** parameter set to a value less than or equal to zero. Other than this,
** no guarantees are made as to the size of the chunks of data returned.

** results are undefined. Furthermore, if it is invoked after any sessions
** related objects have been created, the results are also undefined. 
**
** The first argument to the sqlite3session_config() function must be one
** of the SQLITE_SESSION_CONFIG_XXX constants defined below. The 
** interpretation of the (void*) value passed as the second parameter and
** the effect of calling this function depends on the value of the first
** parameter.

** <dl>
** <dt>SQLITE_SESSION_CONFIG_STRMSIZE<dd>
**    By default, the sessions module streaming interfaces attempt to input
**    and output data in approximately 1 KiB chunks. This operand may be used
**    to set and query the value of this configuration setting. The pointer
**    passed as the second argument must point to a value of type (int).
**    If this value is greater than 0, it is used as the new streaming data
**    chunk size for both input and output. Before returning, the (int) value
**    pointed to by pArg is set to the final value of the streaming interface
**    chunk size.
** </dl>
**
** This function returns SQLITE_OK if successful, or an SQLite error code
** otherwise.
