  This file is intended to be combined at build-time with other
  related code, most notably a header and footer which wraps this
  whole file into an Emscripten Module.postRun() handler. The sqlite3
  JS API has no hard requirements on Emscripten and does not expose
  any Emscripten APIs to clients. It is structured such that its build
  can be tweaked to include it in arbitrary WASM environments which
  can supply the necessary underlying features (e.g. a POSIX file I/O
  layer).

/**
   sqlite3ApiBootstrap() is the only global symbol persistently
   exposed by this API. It is intended to be called one time at the
   end of the API amalgamation process, passed configuration details
   for the current environment, and then optionally be removed from
   the global object using `delete globalThis.sqlite3ApiBootstrap`.

   This function is not intended for client-level use. It is intended
   for use in creating bundles configured for specific WASM
   environments.

   This function expects a configuration object, intended to abstract
   away details specific to any given WASM environment, primarily so
   that it can be used without any _direct_ dependency on
   Emscripten. (Note the default values for the config object!) The
   config object is only honored the first time this is
   called. Subsequent calls ignore the argument and return the same
   (configured) object which gets initialized by the first call.  This
   function will throw if any of the required config options are
   missing.

   The config object properties include:

   - `exports`[^1]: the "exports" object for the current WASM
     environment. In an Emscripten-based build, this should be set to
     `Module['asm']`.

   - `memory`[^1]: optional WebAssembly.Memory object, defaulting to
     `exports.memory`. In Emscripten environments this should be set
     to `Module.wasmMemory` if the build uses `-sIMPORTED_MEMORY`, or be
     left undefined/falsy to default to `exports.memory` when using
     WASM-exported memory.

   - `bigIntEnabled`: true if BigInt support is enabled. Defaults to
     true if `globalThis.BigInt64Array` is available, else false. Some APIs
     will throw exceptions if called without BigInt support, as BigInt
     is required for marshalling C-side int64 into and out of JS.
     (Sidebar: it is technically possible to add int64 support via
     marshalling of int32 pairs, but doing so is unduly invasive.)

   - `allocExportName`: the name of the function, in `exports`, of the
     `malloc(3)`-compatible routine for the WASM environment. Defaults
     to `"sqlite3_malloc"`. Beware that using any allocator other than
     sqlite3_malloc() may require care in certain client-side code
     regarding which allocator is uses. Notably, sqlite3_deserialize()
     and sqlite3_serialize() can only safely use memory from different
     allocators under very specific conditions. The canonical builds
     of this API guaranty that `sqlite3_malloc()` is the JS-side
     allocator implementation.

   - `deallocExportName`: the name of the function, in `exports`, of
     the `free(3)`-compatible routine for the WASM
     environment. Defaults to `"sqlite3_free"`.

   - `reallocExportName`: the name of the function, in `exports`, of
     the `realloc(3)`-compatible routine for the WASM
     environment. Defaults to `"sqlite3_realloc"`.

   - `debug`, `log`, `warn`, and `error` may be functions equivalent
     to the like-named methods of the global `console` object. By
     default, these map directly to their `console` counterparts, but
     can be replaced with (e.g.) empty functions to squelch all such
     output.

   - `wasmfsOpfsDir`[^1]: Specifies the "mount point" of the OPFS-backed
     filesystem in WASMFS-capable builds.


   [^1] = This property may optionally be a function, in which case
          this function calls that function to fetch the value,
          enabling delayed evaluation.

   The returned object is the top-level sqlite3 namespace object.

    /**
       sqlite3_create_function_v2() differs from its native
       counterpart only in the following ways:

       1) The fourth argument (`eTextRep`) argument must not specify
       any encoding other than sqlite3.SQLITE_UTF8. The JS API does not
       currently support any other encoding and likely never
       will. This function does not replace that argument on its own
       because it may contain other flags. As a special case, if
       the bottom 4 bits of that argument are 0, SQLITE_UTF8 is
       assumed.

       2) Any of the four final arguments may be either WASM pointers
       (assumed to be function pointers) or JS Functions. In the
       latter case, each gets bound to WASM using
       sqlite3.capi.wasm.installFunction() and that wrapper is passed
       on to the native implementation.

       For consistency with the C API, it requires the same number of
       arguments. It returns capi.SQLITE_MISUSE if passed any other
       argument count.

       The semantics of JS functions are:

       xFunc: is passed `(pCtx, ...values)`. Its return value becomes
       the new SQL function's result.

       xStep: is passed `(pCtx, ...values)`. Its return value is
       ignored.

       xFinal: is passed `(pCtx)`. Its return value becomes the new
       aggregate SQL function's result.

       xDestroy: is passed `(void*)`. Its return value is ignored. The
       pointer passed to it is the one from the 5th argument to
       sqlite3_create_function_v2().

       Note that:

       - `pCtx` in the above descriptions is a `sqlite3_context*`. At
         least 99 times out of a hundred, that initial argument will
         be irrelevant for JS UDF bindings, but it needs to be there
         so that the cases where it _is_ relevant, in particular with
         window and aggregate functions, have full access to the
         lower-level sqlite3 APIs.

       - When wrapping JS functions, the remaining arguments are passd
         to them as positional arguments, not as an array of
         arguments, because that allows callback definitions to be
         more JS-idiomatic than C-like. For example `(pCtx,a,b)=>a+b`
         is more intuitive and legible than
         `(pCtx,args)=>args[0]+args[1]`. For cases where an array of
         arguments would be more convenient, the callbacks simply need
         to be declared like `(pCtx,...args)=>{...}`, in which case
         `args` will be an array.

       - If a JS wrapper throws, it gets translated to
         sqlite3_result_error() or sqlite3_result_error_nomem(),
         depending on whether the exception is an
         sqlite3.WasmAllocError object or not.

       - When passing on WASM function pointers, arguments are _not_
         converted or reformulated. They are passed on as-is in raw
         pointer form using their native C signatures. Only JS
         functions passed in to this routine, and thus wrapped by this
         routine, get automatic conversions of arguments and result
         values. The routines which perform those conversions are
         exposed for client-side use as
         sqlite3_create_function_v2.convertUdfArgs() and
         sqlite3_create_function_v2.setUdfResult(). sqlite3_create_function()
         and sqlite3_create_window_function() have those same methods.

       For xFunc(), xStep(), and xFinal():

       - When called from SQL, arguments to the UDF, and its result,
         will be converted between JS and SQL with as much fidelity as
         is feasible, triggering an exception if a type conversion
         cannot be determined. Some freedom is afforded to numeric
         conversions due to friction between the JS and C worlds:
         integers which are larger than 32 bits may be treated as
         doubles or BigInts.

       If any JS-side bound functions throw, those exceptions are
       intercepted and converted to database-side errors with the
       exception of xDestroy(): any exception from it is ignored,
       possibly generating a console.error() message.  Destructors
       must not throw.

       Once installed, there is currently no way to uninstall the
       automatically-converted WASM-bound JS functions from WASM. They
       can be uninstalled from the database as documented in the C
       API, but this wrapper currently has no infrastructure in place
       to also free the WASM-bound JS wrappers, effectively resulting
       in a memory leak if the client uninstalls the UDF. Improving that
       is a potential TODO, but removing client-installed UDFs is rare
       in practice. If this factor is relevant for a given client,
       they can create WASM-bound JS functions themselves, hold on to their
       pointers, and pass the pointers in to here. Later on, they can
       free those pointers (using `wasm.uninstallFunction()` or
       equivalent).

       C reference: https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/create_function.html

       Maintenance reminder: the ability to add new
       WASM-accessible functions to the runtime requires that the
       WASM build is compiled with emcc's `-sALLOW_TABLE_GROWTH`
       flag.

       2) sqlite3_prepare_v3(pDb, sqlPointer, sqlByteLen, prepFlags, ppStmt, sqlPointerToPointer)

       Note that the SQL length argument (the 3rd argument) must, for
       usage (1), always be negative because it must be a byte length
       and that value is expensive to calculate from JS (where only
       the character length of strings is readily available). It is
       retained in this API's interface for code/documentation
       compatibility reasons but is currently _always_ ignored. With
       usage (2), the 3rd argument is used as-is but is is still
       critical that the C-style input string (2nd argument) be
       terminated with a 0 byte.

       In usage (1), the 2nd argument must be of type string,
       Uint8Array, Int8Array, or ArrayBuffer (all of which are assumed
       to hold SQL). If it is, this function assumes case (1) and
       calls the underyling C function with the equivalent of:

       (pDb, sqlAsString, -1, prepFlags, ppStmt, null)

       The `pzTail` argument is ignored in this case because its
       result is meaningless when a string-type value is passed
       through: the string goes through another level of internal
       conversion for WASM's sake and the result pointer would refer
       to that transient conversion's memory, not the passed-in
       string.

       If the sql argument is not a string, it must be a _pointer_ to
       a NUL-terminated string which was allocated in the WASM memory
       (e.g. using capi.wasm.alloc() or equivalent). In that case,
       the final argument may be 0/null/undefined or must be a pointer
       to which the "tail" of the compiled SQL is written, as
       documented for the C-side sqlite3_prepare_v3(). In case (2),
       the underlying C function is called with the equivalent of:

       (pDb, sqlAsPointer, sqlByteLen, prepFlags, ppStmt, pzTail)

       It returns its result and compiled statement as documented in
       the C API. Fetching the output pointers (5th and 6th
       parameters) requires using `capi.wasm.peek()` (or
       equivalent) and the `pzTail` will point to an address relative to
       the `sqlAsPointer` value.

       If passed an invalid 2nd argument type, this function will
       return SQLITE_MISUSE and sqlite3_errmsg() will contain a string
       describing the problem.

       Side-note: if given an empty string, or one which contains only
       comments or an empty SQL expression, 0 is returned but the result
       output pointer will be NULL.

  /**
     Deprecation warning: this function does not work properly in
     debug builds of sqlite3 because its out-of-scope use of the
     sqlite3_vfs API triggers assertions in the core library.  That
     was unfortunately not discovered until 2023-08-11. This function
     is now deprecated and should not be used in new code.

     Alternative options:

     - "unix" VFS and its variants can get equivalent functionality
       with sqlite3_js_posix_create_file().

     - OPFS: use either sqlite3.oo1.OpfsDb.importDb(), for the "opfs"
       VFS, or the importDb() method of the PoolUtil object provided
       by the "opfs-sahpool" OPFS (noting that its VFS name may differ
       depending on client-side configuration). We cannot proxy those
       from here because the former is necessarily asynchronous and
       the latter requires information not available to this function.

     Creates a file using the storage appropriate for the given
     sqlite3_vfs.  The first argument may be a VFS name (JS string
     only, NOT a WASM C-string), WASM-managed `sqlite3_vfs*`, or
     a capi.sqlite3_vfs instance. Pass 0 (a NULL pointer) to use the
     default VFS. If passed a string which does not resolve using
     sqlite3_vfs_find(), an exception is thrown. (Note that a WASM
     C-string is not accepted because it is impossible to
     distinguish from a C-level `sqlite3_vfs*`.)

     The second argument, the filename, must be a JS or WASM C-string.

     The 3rd may either be falsy, a valid WASM memory pointer, an
     ArrayBuffer, or a Uint8Array. The 4th must be the length, in
     bytes, of the data array to copy. If the 3rd argument is an
     ArrayBuffer or Uint8Array and the 4th is not a positive integer
     then the 4th defaults to the array's byteLength value.

     If data is falsy then a file is created with dataLen bytes filled
     with uninitialized data (whatever truncate() leaves there). If
     data is not falsy then a file is created or truncated and it is
     filled with the first dataLen bytes of the data source.

     Throws if any arguments are invalid or if creating or writing to
     the file fails.

     Note that most VFSes do _not_ automatically create directory
     parts of filenames, nor do all VFSes have a concept of
     directories.  If the given filename is not valid for the given
     VFS, an exception will be thrown. This function exists primarily
     to assist in implementing file-upload capability, with the caveat
     that clients must have some idea of the VFS into which they want
     to upload and that VFS must support the operation.

     VFS-specific notes:

     - "memdb": results are undefined.

     - "kvvfs": will fail with an I/O error due to strict internal
       requirments of that VFS's xTruncate().

     - "unix" and related: will use the WASM build's equivalent of the
       POSIX I/O APIs. This will work so long as neither a specific
       VFS nor the WASM environment imposes requirements which break it.

     - "opfs": uses OPFS storage and creates directory parts of the
       filename. It can only be used to import an SQLite3 database
       file and will fail if given anything else.

  /**
     Given a (sqlite3_value*), this function attempts to convert it
     to an equivalent JS value with as much fidelity as feasible and
     return it.

     By default it throws if it cannot determine any sensible
     conversion. If passed a falsy second argument, it instead returns
     `undefined` if no suitable conversion is found.  Note that there
     is no conversion from SQL to JS which results in the `undefined`
     value, so `undefined` has an unambiguous meaning here.  It will
     always throw a WasmAllocError if allocating memory for a
     conversion fails.

     Caveats:

     - It does not support sqlite3_value_to_pointer() conversions
       because those require a type name string which this function
       does not have and cannot sensibly be given at the level of the
       API where this is used (e.g. automatically converting UDF
       arguments). Clients using sqlite3_value_to_pointer(), and its
       related APIs, will need to manage those themselves.
