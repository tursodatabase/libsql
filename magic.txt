# This file contains suggested magic(5) text for the unix file(1)
# utility for recognizing SQLite3 databases.
#
# When SQLite is used as an application file format, it is desirable to
# have file(1) recognize the database file as being with the specific
# application.  You can set the application_id for a database file
# using:
#
#     PRAGMA application_id = INTEGER;
#
# INTEGER can be any signed 32-bit integer.  That integer is written as
# a 4-byte big-endian integer into offset 68 of the database header.
#
# The Monotone application used "PRAGMA user_version=1598903374;" to set
# its identifier long before "PRAGMA application_id" became available.
# The user_version is very similar to application_id except that it is
# stored at offset 60 instead of offset 68.  The application_id pragma
# is preferred.  The rule using offset 60 for Monotone is for historical
# compatibility only.
