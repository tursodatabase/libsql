# "It's like Git, for your data."

CR-SQLite is a [run-time loadable extension](https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html) for [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and [libSQL](https://github.com/libsql/libsql). It allows merging different SQLite databases together that have taken independent writes.

In other words, you can write to your SQLite database while offline. I can write to mine while offline. We can then both come online and merge our databases together, without conflict.

**In technical terms:** cr-sqlite adds multi-master replication and partition tolerance to SQLite via conflict free replicated data types ([CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)) and/or causally ordered event logs.

# When is this useful?

1. Syncing data between devices
2. Implementing realtime collaboration
3. Offline editing
4. Being resilient to network conditions
5. Enabling instantaneous interactions

All of the above involve a merging of independent edits problem. If your database can handle this for you, you don't need custom code in your application to handle those 5 cases.

# Usage

The full documentation site is available [here](https://vlcn.io/docs/getting-started).

`crsqlite` exposes three main APIs:

- A function extension (`crsql_as_crr`) to upgrade existing tables to "crrs" or "conflict free replicated relations"
  - `SELECT crsql_as_crr('table_name')`
- A virtual table (`crsql_changes`) to ask the database for changesets or to apply changesets from another database
  - `SELECT * FROM crsql_changes WHERE db_version > x AND site_id IS NULL` -- to get local changes
  - `SELECT * FROM crsql_changes WHERE db_version > x AND site_id IS NOT some_site` -- to get all changes excluding those synced from some site
  - `INSERT INTO crsql_changes VALUES ([patches received from select on another peer])`
- And `crsql_begin_alter('table_name')` & `crsql_alter_commit('table_name')` primitives to allow altering table definitions that have been upgraded to `crr`s.
  - Until we move forward with extending the syntax of SQLite to be CRR aware, altering CRRs looks like:
    ```sql
    SELECT crsql_begin_alter('table_name');
    -- 1 or more alterations to `table_name`
    ALTER TABLE table_name ...;
    SELECT crsql_commit_alter('table_name');
    ```
    A future version of cr-sqlite may extend the SQL syntax to make this more natural.

Application code uses the function extension to enable crr support on tables.

Networking code uses the `crsql_changes` virtual table to fetch and apply changes.

Usage looks like:

```sql
-- load the extension if it is not statically linked
.load crsqlite
.mode column
-- create tables as normal
create table foo (a primary key, b);
create table baz (a primary key, b, c, d);

-- update those tables to be crrs / crdts
select crsql_as_crr('foo');
select crsql_as_crr('baz');

-- insert some data / interact with tables as normal
insert into foo (a,b) values (1,2);
insert into baz (a,b,c,d) values ('a', 'woo', 'doo', 'daa');

-- ask for a record of what has changed
select * from crsql_changes;

table  pk   cid  val    col_version  db_version  site_id
-----  ---  ---  -----  -----------  ----------  -------
foo    1    b    2      1            1           1(�zL
                                                 \hx

baz    'a'  b    'woo'  1            2           1(�zL
                                                 \hx

baz    'a'  c    'doo'  1            2           1(�zL
                                                 \hx

baz    'a'  d    'daa'  1            2           1(�zL
                                                 \hx

-- merge changes from a peer
insert into crsql_changes
  ("table", pk, cid, val, col_version, db_version, site_id)
  values
  ('foo', 5, 'b', '''thing''', 5, 5, X'7096E2D505314699A59C95FABA14ABB5');
insert into crsql_changes ("table", pk, cid, val, col_version, db_version, site_id)
  values
  ('baz', '''a''', 'b', 123, 101, 233, X'7096E2D505314699A59C95FABA14ABB5');

-- check that peer's changes were applied
select * from foo;
a  b
-  -----
1  2
5  thing

select * from baz;
a  b    c    d
-  ---  ---  ---
a  123  doo  daa

-- tear down the extension before closing the connection

select crsql_finalize();
```

# Example Apps

Example apps that use `cr-sqlite`:

- Basic setup & sync via an [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/@tantaman/cr-sqlite-basic-setup)
- TodoMVC - https://github.com/vlcn-io/live-examples
- [Tutorials](https://vlcn.io/docs/guide-sync)
- [WIP Local-First Presentation Editor](https://github.com/tantaman/strut)

# Packages

Pre-built binaries of the extension are available in the [releases section](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/releases).

These can be loaded into `sqlite` via the [`load_extension` command](https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html#loading_an_extension) from any language (Python, NodeJS, C++, Rust, etc.) that has SQLite bindings.

The entrypoint to the loadable extension is [`sqlite3_crsqlite_init` ](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/blob/92df9b4f3a6bdf2bd7c5d9a76949496fa5dc88cf/core/src/crsqlite.c#L536) so you'll either need to provide that to `load_extension` or rename your binary to `crsqlite.[dylib/dll/so]`. See the linked sqlite [`load_extension` docs](https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html#loading_an_extension).

> Note: if you're using `cr-sqlite` as a run time loadable extension, loading the extension should be the _first_ operation you do after opening a connection to the database. The extension needs to be loaded on every connection you create.

For a WASM build that works in the browser, see the [js](./js) directory.

For UI integrations (e.g., React) see the [js](./js) directory.

# How does it work?

There are two approaches with very different tradeoffs. Both will eventually be supported by `cr-sqlite`. `v1` (and current releases) support the first approach. `v2` will support both approaches.

## Approach 1: History-free CRDTs

Approach 1 is characterized by the following properties:

1. Keeps no history / only keeps the current state
2. Automatically handles merge conflicts. No options for manual merging.
3. Tables are Grow Only Sets or variants of Observe-Remove Sets
4. Rows are maps of CRDTs. The column names being the keys, column values being a specific CRDT type
5. Columns can be counter, fractional index or last write wins CRDTs.
   1. multi-value registers, RGA and others to come in future iterations

Tables which should be synced are defined as a composition of other types of CRDTs.

Example table definition:

```sql
CREATE CLSet post (
 id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 views COUNTER,
 content PERITEXT,
 owner_id LWW INTEGER
);
```

> note: given that extensions can't extend the SQLite syntax this is notional. We are, however, extending the libSQL syntax so this will be available in that fork. In base SQLite you'd run the `select crsql_as_crr` function as seen earlier.

- CLSet - [causal length set](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3380787.3393678)
- COUNTER - [distributed counter](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/cs380p/papers/Counters.html)
- PERITEXT - [collaborative text](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/)

Under approach 1, merging two tables works roughly like so:

1. Rows are identified by primary key
2. Tables are unioned (and a delete log is consulted) such that both tables will have the same rows.

If a row was modified in multiple places, then we merge the row. Merging a row involves merging each column of that row according to the semantics of the CRDT for the column.

1. Last-write wins just picks the lastest write
2. Counter CRDT sums the values
3. Multi-value registers keep all conflicting values
4. Fractional indices are taken as last write

For more background see [this post](https://vlcn.io/blog/gentle-intro-to-crdts.html).

Notes:

- LWW, Fractional Index, Observe-Remove sets are available now.
- Counter and rich-text CRDTs are still [being implemented](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/issues/65).
- Custom SQL syntax will be available in our libSQL integration. The SQLite extension requires a slightly different syntax than what is depicted above.

## Approach 2: Causal Event Log

> To be implemented in v2 of cr-sqlite

Approach 2 has the following properties:

1. A history of every modification that happens to the database is kept
   1. This history can be garbage collected in certain network topologies
2. Merge conflicts can be automatically handled (via CRDT style rules) or the developer can define their own conflict resolution plan.
3. The developer can choose to fork the data on merge conflict rather than merging
4. Forks can live indefinitely or a specific fork can be chosen and other forks dropped

This is much more akin to git and event sourcing but with the drawback being that it is much more write heavy and much more space intensive.

# Building

You'll need to install Rust and the nightly toolchain.

- Installing Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- Adding the nightly toolchain: `rustup toolchain install nightly`

If you're building on windows: `rustup toolchain install nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`

## [Run Time Loadable Extension](https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.htmla)

Instructions on building a native library that can be loaded into SQLite in non-wasm environments.

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly # make sure you have the rust nightly toolchain
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:vlcn-io/cr-sqlite.git
cd cr-sqlite/core
make loadable
```

This will create a shared library at `dist/crsqlite.[lib extension]`

[lib extension]:

- Linux: `.so`
- Darwin / OS X: `.dylib`
- Windows: `.dll`

## WASM

For a WASM build that works in the browser, see the [js](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/tree/main/js) directory.

## CLI

Instructions on building a `sqlite3` CLI that has `cr-sqlite` statically linked and pre-loaded.

In the `core` directory of the project, run:

```bash
make sqlite3
```

This will create a `sqlite3` binary at `dist/sqlite3`

## Tests

core:

```bash
cd core
make test
```

js integration tests:

```bash
cd js
make test
```

py integration tests:

```bash
cd py/correctness
pip install -e .
export PYTHONPATH=./src
pytest
```

# JS APIs

JS APIs for using `cr-sqlite` in the browser are not yet documented but exist in the [js dir](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/tree/main/js). You can also see examples of them in use here:

- [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/@tantaman/cr-sqlite-basic-setup)
