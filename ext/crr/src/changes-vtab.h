/**
 * The changes virtual table is an eponymous virtual table which can be used
 * to fetch and apply patches to a db.
 *
 * To fetch a changeset:
 * ```sql
 * SELECT * FROM crsql_chages WHERE site_id IS NOT SITE_ID AND version > V
 * ```
 *
 * The site id parameter is used to prevent a site from fetching its own
 * changes that were patched into the remote.
 *
 * The version parameter is used to get changes after a specific version.
 * Sites should keep track of the latest version they've received from other
 * sites and use that number as a cursor to fetch future changes.
 *
 * The changes table has the following columns:
 * 1. table - the name of the table the patch is from
 * 2. pk - the primary key(s) that identify the row to be patched. If the
 *    table has many columns that comprise the primary key then
 *    the values are quote concatenated in pk order.
 * 3. col_vals - the values to patch. quote concatenated in cid order.
 * 4. col_versions - the cids of the changed columns and the versions of those
 * columns
 * 5. version - the min version of the patch. Used for filtering and for sites
 * to update their "last seen" version from other sites
 * 6. site_id - the site_id that is responsible for the update. If this is 0
 *    then the update was made locally.
 *
 * To apply a changeset:
 * ```sql
 * INSERT INTO changes (table, pk, col_vals, col_versions, site_id) VALUES
 * (...)
 * ```
