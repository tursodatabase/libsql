/**
   Helper classes for handling JNI output pointers.

   We do not use a generic OutputPointer<T> because working with those
   from the native JNI code is unduly quirky due to a lack of
   autoboxing at that level.

   The usage is similar for all of thes types:

   ```
   OutputPointer.sqlite3 out = new OutputPointer.sqlite3();
   assert( null==out.get() );
   int rc = sqlite3_open(":memory:", out);
   if( 0!=rc ) ... error;
   assert( null!=out.get() );
   sqlite3 db = out.take();
   assert( null==out.get() );
   ```

   With the minor exception that the primitive types permit direct
   access to the object's value via the `value` property, whereas the
   JNI-level opaque types do not permit client-level code to set that
   property.
