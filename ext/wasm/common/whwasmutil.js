/**
   This function is intended to simplify porting around various bits
   of WASM-related utility code from project to project.

   The primary goal of this code is to replace, where possible,
   Emscripten-generated glue code with equivalent utility code which
   can be used in arbitrary WASM environments built with toolchains
   other than Emscripten. As of this writing, this code is capable of
   acting as a replacement for Emscripten's generated glue code
   _except_ that the latter installs handlers for Emscripten-provided
   APIs such as its "FS" (virtual filesystem) API. Loading of such
   things still requires using Emscripten's glue, but the post-load
   utility APIs provided by this code are still usable as replacements
   for their sub-optimally-documented Emscripten counterparts.

   Intended usage:

   ```
   self.WhWasmUtilInstaller(appObject);
   delete self.WhWasmUtilInstaller;
   ```

   Its global-scope symbol is intended only to provide an easy way to
   make it available to 3rd-party scripts and "should" be deleted
   after calling it. That symbols is _not_ used within the library.

   Forewarning: this API explicitly targets only browser
   environments. If a given non-browser environment has the
   capabilities needed for a given feature (e.g. TextEncoder), great,
   but it does not go out of its way to account for them and does not
   provide compatibility crutches for them.

   It currently offers alternatives to the following
   Emscripten-generated APIs:

   - OPTIONALLY memory allocation, but how this gets imported is
     environment-specific.  Most of the following features only work
     if allocation is available.

   - WASM-exported "indirect function table" access and
     manipulation. e.g.  creating new WASM-side functions using JS
     functions, analog to Emscripten's addFunction() and
     uninstallFunction() but slightly different.

   - Get/set specific heap memory values, analog to Emscripten's
     getValue() and setValue().

   - String length counting in UTF-8 bytes (C-style and JS strings).

   - JS string to C-string conversion and vice versa, analog to
     Emscripten's stringToUTF8Array() and friends, but with slighter
     different interfaces.

   - JS string to Uint8Array conversion, noting that browsers actually
     already have this built in via TextEncoder.

   - "Scoped" allocation, such that allocations made inside of a given
     explicit scope will be automatically cleaned up when the scope is
     closed. This is fundamentally similar to Emscripten's
     stackAlloc() and friends but uses the heap instead of the stack
     because access to the stack requires C code.

   - Create JS wrappers for WASM functions, analog to Emscripten's
     ccall() and cwrap() functions, except that the automatic
     conversions for function arguments and return values can be
     easily customized by the client by assigning custom function
     signature type names to conversion functions. Essentially,
     it's ccall() and cwrap() on steroids.

   How to install...

   Passing an object to this function will install the functionality
   into that object. Afterwards, client code "should" delete the global
   symbol.

   This code requires that the target object have the following
   properties, noting that they needn't be available until the first
   time one of the installed APIs is used (as opposed to when this
   function is called) except where explicitly noted:

   - `exports` must be a property of the target object OR a property
     of `target.instance` (a WebAssembly.Module instance) and it must
     contain the symbols exported by the WASM module associated with
     this code. In an Enscripten environment it must be set to
     `Module['asm']`. The exports object must contain a minimum of the
     following symbols:

     - `memory`: a WebAssembly.Memory object representing the WASM
       memory. _Alternately_, the `memory` property can be set as
       `target.memory`, in particular if the WASM heap memory is
       initialized in JS an _imported_ into WASM, as opposed to being
       initialized in WASM and exported to JS.

     - `__indirect_function_table`: the WebAssembly.Table object which
       holds WASM-exported functions. This API does not strictly
       require that the table be able to grow but it will throw if its
       `installFunction()` is called and the table cannot grow.

   In order to simplify downstream usage, if `target.exports` is not
   set when this is called then a property access interceptor
   (read-only, configurable, enumerable) gets installed as `exports`
   which resolves to `target.instance.exports`, noting that the latter
   property need not exist until the first time `target.exports` is
   accessed.

   Some APIs _optionally_ make use of the `bigIntEnabled` property of
   the target object. It "should" be set to true if the WASM
   environment is compiled with BigInt support, else it must be
   false. If it is false, certain BigInt-related features will trigger
   an exception if invoked. This property, if not set when this is
   called, will get a default value of true only if the BigInt64Array
   constructor is available, else it will default to false. Note that
   having the BigInt type is not sufficient for full int64 integration
   with WASM: the target WASM file must also have been built with
   that support. In Emscripten that's done using the `-sWASM_BIGINT`
   flag.

   Some optional APIs require that the target have the following
   methods:

   - 'alloc()` must behave like C's `malloc()`, allocating N bytes of
     memory and returning its pointer. In Emscripten this is
     conventionally made available via `Module['_malloc']`. This API
     requires that the alloc routine throw on allocation error, as
     opposed to returning null or 0.

   - 'dealloc()` must behave like C's `free()`, accepting either a
     pointer returned from its allocation counterpart or the values
     null/0 (for which it must be a no-op). allocating N bytes of
     memory and returning its pointer. In Emscripten this is
     conventionally made available via `Module['_free']`.

   APIs which require allocation routines are explicitly documented as
   such and/or have "alloc" in their names.

   Jaccwabyt project:

     addFunction()-format function signature string. In short: in may
     have one of the following formats:

     - Emscripten: `"x..."`, where the first x is a letter representing
       the result type and subsequent letters represent the argument
       types. Functions with no arguments have only a single
       letter. See below.

     - Jaccwabyt: `"x(...)"` where `x` is the letter representing the
       result type and letters in the parens (if any) represent the
       argument types. Functions with no arguments use `x()`. See
       below.

     Supported letters:

     - `i` = int32
     - `p` = int32 ("pointer")
     - `j` = int64
     - `f` = float32
     - `d` = float64
     - `v` = void, only legal for use as the result type

     It throws if an invalid signature letter is used.

     Jaccwabyt-format signatures support some additional letters which
     have no special meaning here but (in this context) act as aliases
     for other letters:

     - `s`, `P`: same as `p`

     Sidebar: this code is developed together with Jaccwabyt, thus the
     support for its signature format.

     function's index in that table (which acts as a pointer to that
     function). The returned pointer can be passed to
     uninstallFunction() to uninstall it and free up the table slot for
     reuse.

     If passed (string,function) arguments then it treats the first

     As a special case, if the passed-in function is a WASM-exported
     function then the signature argument is ignored and func is

     The former case can happen in an Emscripten-compiled

     undocumented behavior of reusing a function if it's passed to
     addFunction() more than once, which leads to uninstallFunction()

  /**
     Given a WASM heap memory address and a data type name in the form
     (i8, i16, i32, i64, float (or f32), double (or f64)), this
     fetches the numeric value from that address and returns it as a
     number or, for the case of type='i64', a BigInt (noting that that
     type triggers an exception if this.bigIntEnabled is
     falsy). Throws if given an invalid type.

     If the first argument is an array, it is treated as an array of
     addresses and the result is an array of the values from each of
     those address, using the same 2nd argument for determining the
     value type to fetch.

     As a special case, if type ends with a `*`, it is considered to
     be a pointer type and is treated as the WASM numeric type
     appropriate for the pointer size (`i32`).

     While likely not obvious, this routine and its poke()
     counterpart are how pointer-to-value _output_ parameters
     in WASM-compiled C code can be interacted with:

     ```
     const ptr = alloc(4);
     poke(ptr, 0, 'i32'); // clear the ptr's value
     aCFuncWithOutputPtrToInt32Arg( ptr ); // e.g. void foo(int *x);
     const result = peek(ptr, 'i32'); // fetch ptr's value
     dealloc(ptr);
     ```

     scopedAlloc() and friends can be used to make handling of
     `ptr` safe against leaks in the case of an exception:

     ```
     let result;
     const scope = scopedAllocPush();
     try{
       const ptr = scopedAlloc(4);
       poke(ptr, 0, 'i32');
       aCFuncWithOutputPtrArg( ptr );
       result = peek(ptr, 'i32');
     }finally{
       scopedAllocPop(scope);
     }
     ```

     As a rule poke() must be called to set (typically zero
     out) the pointer's value, else it will contain an essentially
     random value.

     ACHTUNG: calling this often, e.g. in a loop, can have a noticably
     painful impact on performance. Rather than doing so, use
     heapForSize() to fetch the heap object and read directly from it.

     bytes) or whether they may use the default pointer size
     (typically 4 but also possibly 8).

     An attempt at adding function pointer conversion support to

     converting a JS function to a C-side function, either
     permanently, for the duration of a single call into the C layer,
     or semi-contextual, where it may keep track of a single binding
     for a given context and uninstall the binding if it's replaced.

     The constructor requires an options object with these properties:

     - name (optional): string describing the function binding. This
       is solely for debugging and error-reporting purposes. If not
       provided, an empty string is assumed.

     - signature: a function signature string compatible with
       jsFuncToWasm().

     - bindScope (string): one of ('transient', 'context',
       'singleton'). Bind scopes are:

       - 'transient': it will convert JS functions to WASM only for
         the duration of the xWrap()'d function call, using
         scopedInstallFunction(). Before that call returns, the
         WASM-side binding will be uninstalled.

       - 'singleton': holds one function-pointer binding for this
         instance. If it's called with a different function pointer,
         it uninstalls the previous one after converting the new
         value. This is only useful for use with "global" functions
         which do not rely on any state other than this function
         pointer. If the being-converted function pointer is intended
         to be mapped to some sort of state object (e.g. an
         `sqlite3*`) then "context" (see below) is the proper mode.

       - 'context': similar to singleton mode but for a given
         "context", where the context is a key provided by the user
         and possibly dependent on a small amount of call-time
         context. This mode is the default if bindScope is _not_ set
         but a property named contextKey (described below) is.

       - 'permanent': the function is installed and left there
         forever. There is no way to recover its pointer address
         later on.

     - callProxy (function): if set, this must be a function which
       will act as a proxy for any "converted" JS function. It is
       passed the being-converted function value and must return
       either that function or a function which acts on its
       behalf. The returned function will be the one which gets
       installed into the WASM function table. The proxy must perform
       any required argument conversion (noting that it will be called
       from C code, so will receive C-format arguments) before passing
       them on to the being-converted function. Whether or not the
       proxy itself must return a value depends on the context. If it
       does, it must be a WASM-friendly value, as it will be returning
       from a call made from native code.

     - contextKey (function): is only used if bindScope is 'context'
       or if bindScope is not set and this function is, in which case
       'context' is assumed. This function gets bound to this object,
       so its "this" is this object. It gets passed (argv,argIndex),
       where argIndex is the index of _this_ function pointer in its
       _wrapping_ function's arguments and argv is the _current_
       still-being-xWrap()-processed args array. All arguments to the
       left of argIndex will have been processed by xWrap() by the
       time this is called. argv[argIndex] will be the value the user
       passed in to the xWrap()'d function for the argument this
       FuncPtrAdapter is mapped to. Arguments to the right of
       argv[argIndex] will not yet have been converted before this is
       called. The function must return a key which uniquely
       identifies this function mapping context for _this_
       FuncPtrAdapter instance (other instances are not considered),
       taking into account that C functions often take some sort of
       state object as one or more of their arguments. As an example,
       if the xWrap()'d function takes `(int,T*,functionPtr,X*)` and
       this FuncPtrAdapter is the argv[2]nd arg, contextKey(argv,2)
       might return 'T@'+argv[1], or even just argv[1].  Note,
       however, that the (X*) argument will not yet have been
       processed by the time this is called and should not be used as
       part of that key because its pre-conversion data type might be
       unpredictable. Similarly, care must be taken with C-string-type
       arguments: those to the left in argv will, when this is called,
       be WASM pointers, whereas those to the right might (and likely
       do) have another data type. When using C-strings in keys, never
       use their pointers in the key because most C-strings in this
       constellation are transient.

     Yes, that ^^^ is quite awkward, but it's what we have.

     The constructor only saves the above state for later, and does
     not actually bind any functions. Its convertArg() method is
     called via xWrap() to perform any bindings.

     Shortcomings:

     - These "reverse" bindings, i.e. calling into a JS-defined
       function from a WASM-defined function (the generated proxy
       wrapper), lack all type conversion support. That means, for
       example, that...

     - Function pointers which include C-string arguments may still
       need a level of hand-written wrappers around them, depending on
       how they're used, in order to provide the client with JS
       strings. Alternately, clients will need to perform such conversions
       on their own, e.g. using cstrtojs(). Or maybe we can find a way
       to perform such conversions here, via addition of an xWrap()-style
       function signature to the options argument.

  /**
     Creates a wrapper for another function which converts the arguments
     of the wrapper to argument types accepted by the wrapped function,
     then converts the wrapped function's result to another form
     for the wrapper.

     The first argument must be one of:

     - A JavaScript function.
     - The name of a WASM-exported function. In the latter case xGet()
       is used to fetch the exported function, which throws if it's not
       found.
     - A pointer into the indirect function table. e.g. a pointer
       returned from target.installFunction().

     It returns either the passed-in function or a wrapper for that
     function which converts the JS-side argument types into WASM-side
     types and converts the result type.

     The second argument, `resultType`, describes the conversion for
     the wrapped functions result. A literal `null` or the string
     `'null'` both mean to return the original function's value as-is
     (mnemonic: there is "null" conversion going on). Literal
     `undefined` or the string `"void"` both mean to ignore the
     function's result and return `undefined`. Aside from those two
     special cases, the `resultType` value may be one of the values
     described below or any mapping installed by the client using
     xWrap.resultAdapter().

     If passed 3 arguments and the final one is an array, that array
     must contain a list of type names (see below) for adapting the
     arguments from JS to WASM.  If passed 2 arguments, more than 3,
     or the 3rd is not an array, all arguments after the 2nd (if any)
     are treated as type names. i.e.:

     ```
     xWrap('funcname', 'i32', 'string', 'f64');
     // is equivalent to:
     xWrap('funcname', 'i32', ['string', 'f64']);
     ```

     This function enforces that the given list of arguments has the
     same arity as the being-wrapped function (as defined by its
     `length` property) and it will throw if that is not the case.
     Similarly, the created wrapper will throw if passed a differing
     argument count.

     Type names are symbolic names which map the arguments to an
     adapter function to convert, if needed, the value before passing
     it on to WASM or to convert a return result from WASM. The list
     of built-in names:

     - `i8`, `i16`, `i32` (args and results): all integer conversions
       which convert their argument to an integer and truncate it to
       the given bit length.

     - `N*` (args): a type name in the form `N*`, where N is a numeric
       type name, is treated the same as WASM pointer.

     - `*` and `pointer` (args): are assumed to be WASM pointer values
       and are returned coerced to an appropriately-sized pointer
       value (i32 or i64). Non-numeric values will coerce to 0 and
       out-of-range values will have undefined results (just as with
       any pointer misuse).

     - `*` and `pointer` (results): aliases for the current
       WASM pointer numeric type.

     - `**` (args): is simply a descriptive alias for the WASM pointer
       type. It's primarily intended to mark output-pointer arguments.

     - `i64` (args and results): passes the value to BigInt() to
       convert it to an int64. Only available if bigIntEnabled is
       true.

     - `f32` (`float`), `f64` (`double`) (args and results): pass
       their argument to Number(). i.e. the adapter does not currently
       distinguish between the two types of floating-point numbers.

     - `number` (results): converts the result to a JS Number using
       Number(theValue).valueOf(). Note that this is for result
       conversions only, as it's not possible to generically know
       which type of number to convert arguments to.

     Non-numeric conversions include:

     - `null` literal or `"null"` string (args and results): perform
       no translation and pass the arg on as-is. This is primarily
       useful for results but may have a use or two for arguments.

     - `string` or `utf8` (args): has two different semantics in order
       to accommodate various uses of certain C APIs
       (e.g. output-style strings)...

       - If the arg is a string, it creates a _temporary_
         UTF-8-encoded C-string to pass to the exported function,
         cleaning it up before the wrapper returns. If a long-lived
         C-string pointer is required, that requires client-side code
         to create the string, then pass its pointer to the function.

       - Else the arg is assumed to be a pointer to a string the
         client has already allocated and it's passed on as
         a WASM pointer.

     - `string` or `utf8` (results): treats the result value as a
       const C-string, encoded as UTF-8, copies it to a JS string,
       and returns that JS string.

     - `string:dealloc` or `utf8:dealloc) (results): treats the result value
       as a non-const UTF-8 C-string, ownership of which has just been
       transfered to the caller. It copies the C-string to a JS
       string, frees the C-string, and returns the JS string. If such
       a result value is NULL, the JS result is `null`. Achtung: when
       using an API which returns results from a specific allocator,
       e.g. `my_malloc()`, this conversion _is not legal_. Instead, an
       equivalent conversion which uses the appropriate deallocator is
       required. For example:

```js
   target.xWrap.resultAdapter('string:my_free',(i)=>{
      try { return i ? target.cstrToJs(i) : null }
      finally{ target.exports.my_free(i) }
   };
```

     - `json` (results): treats the result as a const C-string and
       returns the result of passing the converted-to-JS string to
       JSON.parse(). Returns `null` if the C-string is a NULL pointer.

     - `json:dealloc` (results): works exactly like `string:dealloc` but
       returns the same thing as the `json` adapter. Note the
       warning in `string:dealloc` regarding maching allocators and
       deallocators.

     The type names for results and arguments are validated when
     xWrap() is called and any unknown names will trigger an
     exception.

     Clients may map their own result and argument adapters using
     xWrap.resultAdapter() and xWrap.argAdapter(), noting that not all
     type conversions are valid for both arguments _and_ result types
     as they often have different memory ownership requirements.

     Design note: the ability to pass in a JS function as the first
     argument is of relatively limited use, primarily for testing
     argument and result converters. JS functions, by and large, will
     not want to deal with C-type arguments.

     TODOs:

     - Figure out how/whether we can (semi-)transparently handle
       pointer-type _output_ arguments. Those currently require
       explicit handling by allocating pointers, assigning them before
       the call using poke(), and fetching them with
       peek() after the call. We may be able to automate some
       or all of that.

     - Figure out whether it makes sense to extend the arg adapter
       interface such that each arg adapter gets an array containing
       the results of the previous arguments in the current call. That
       might allow some interesting type-conversion feature. Use case:
       handling of the final argument to sqlite3_prepare_v2() depends
       on the type (pointer vs JS string) of its 2nd
       argument. Currently that distinction requires hand-writing a
       wrapper for that function. That case is unusual enough that
       abstracting it into this API (and taking on the associated
       costs) may well not make good sense.

     argument is the result object from
     WebAssembly.instantiate[Streaming](). The 2nd is the config
     object passed to this function. Described in more detail below.

   - `imports`: optional imports object for

     of imports. If the module requires any imports, this object
     must include them.

   - `wasmUtilTarget`: optional object suitable for passing to

     - If `wasmUtilTarget.alloc` is not set and
       `instance.exports.malloc` is, it installs
       `wasmUtilTarget.alloc()` and `wasmUtilTarget.dealloc()`
       wrappers for the exports `malloc` and `free` functions.

   It returns a function which, when called, initiates loading of the
   module and returns a Promise. When that Promise resolves, it calls
   the `config.onload` callback (if set) and passes it
   `(loadResult,config)`, where `loadResult` is the result of
   WebAssembly.instantiate[Streaming](): an object in the form:

   ```
   {
     module: a WebAssembly.Module,
     instance: a WebAssembly.Instance
   }
   ```

   (Note that the initial `then()` attached to the promise gets only
   that object, and not the `config` one.)

   Error handling is up to the caller, who may attach a `catch()` call
   to the promise.
