This is the README for the sqlite3 WASM/JS distribution.

Main project page: https://sqlite.org

Documentation: https://sqlite.org/wasm

This archive contains the following deliverables for the WASM/JS
build:

- jswasm/sqlite3.js is the canonical "vanilla JS" version.

- jswasm/sqlite3.mjs is the same but in ES6 module form

- jswasm/*-bundler-friendly.js and .mjs are variants which are
  intended to be compatible with "bundler" tools commonly seen in
  node.js-based projects. Projects using such tools should use those
  variants, where available, instead of files without the
  "-bundler-friendly" suffix. Some files do not have separate
  variants.

- jswasm/sqlite3.wasm is the binary WASM file imported by all of the
  above-listed JS files.

- The jswasm directory additionally contains a number of supplemental
  JS files which cannot be bundled directly with the main JS files
  but are necessary for certain usages.

- The top-level directory contains various demonstration and test
  applications for sqlite3.js and sqlite3.mjs.
  sqlite3-bundler-friendly.mjs requires client-side build tools to make
  use of and is not demonstrated here.

Browsers will not serve WASM files from file:// URLs, so the test and
demonstration apps require a web server and that server must include
the following headers in its response when serving the files:

    Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
    Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp

The core library will function without those headers but certain
features, most notably OPFS storage, will not be available.

One simple way to get the demo apps up and running on Unix-style
systems is to install althttpd (https://sqlite.org/althttpd) and run:

    althttpd --enable-sab --page index.html
