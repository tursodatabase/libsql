  This file is intended to be loaded after loading sqlite3.wasm. It
  sets up one of any number of potential bindings using that API, this
  one as closely matching the C-native API as is feasible in JS.

  Note that this file is not named sqlite3.js because that file gets
  generated by emscripten as the JS-glue counterpart of sqlite3.wasm.

  This code installs an object named self.sqlite3, where self is
  expected to be either the global window or Worker object:

  self.sqlite3 = {
      api: core WASM bindings of sqlite3 APIs,
      SQLite3: high-level OO API wrapper
  };

  The way we export this module is not _really_ modern-JS-friendly
  because it exports a global symbol (which is admittedly not
  ideal). Exporting it "cleanly," without introducing any global-scope
  symbols, requires using a module loader in all client code. As there
  are several different approaches, none of which this developer is
  currently truly familiar with, the current approach will have to do
  for the time being.

  Because using the low-level API properly requires some degree of
  WASM-related magic, it is not recommended that that API be used
  as-is in client-level code. Rather, client code should use the
  higher-level OO API or write a custom wrapper on top of the
  lower-level API.

  This file installs namespace.sqlite3, where namespace is `self`,
  meaning either the global window or worker, depending on where this
  is loaded from.

  # Goals and Non-goals of this API

  Goals:

  - Except where noted in the non-goals, provide a more-or-less
    complete wrapper to the sqlite3 C API, insofar as WASM feature
    parity with C allows for. In fact, provide at least 3...

  - (1) The aforementioned C-style API. (2) An OO-style API on
    top of that, designed to run in the same thread (main window or
    Web Worker) as the C API. (3) A less-capable wrapper which can
    work across the main window/worker boundary, where the sqlite3 API
    is one of those and this wrapper is in the other. That
    constellation places some considerable limitations on how the API
    can be interacted with, but keeping the DB operations out of the
    UI thread is generally desirable.


  Non-goals:

  - As WASM is a web-based technology and UTF-8 is the King of
    Encodings in that realm, there are no plans to support the
    UTF16-related APIs will not be. They would add a complication to
    the bindings for no appreciable benefit.

  - Supporting old or niche-market platforms. WASM is built for a
    modern web and requires modern platforms.

    /* For reference: sql.js does essentially everything we want and
       it solves much of the wasm-related voodoo, but we'll need a
       different structure because we want the db connection to run in
       a worker thread and feed data back into the main
       thread. Regardless of those differences, it makes a great point
       of reference:

       https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js

       Some of the specific design goals here:

       - Bind a low-level sqlite3 API which is close to the native one
         in terms of usage.

       - Create a higher-level one, more akin to sql.js and
         node.js-style implementations. This one would speak directly
         to the low-level API. This API could be used by clients who
         import the low-level API directly into their main thread
         (which we don't want to recommend but also don't want to
         outright forbid).

       - Create a second higher-level one which speaks to the
         low-level API via worker messages. This one would be intended
         for use in the main thread, talking to the low-level UI via
         worker messages. Because workers have only a single message
         channel, some acrobatics will be needed here to feed async
         work results back into client-side callbacks (as those
         callbacks cannot simply be passed to the worker). Exactly
         what those acrobatics should look like is not yet entirely
         clear and much experimentation is pending.

           - .callback = a function which gets called for each row of
             the FIRST statement in the SQL (if it has any result
             rows). The second argument passed to the callback is
             always the current Stmt object (so that the caller
             may collect column names, or similar). The first
             argument passed to the callback defaults to the current
             Stmt object but may be changed with ...

           - .rowMode = a string describing what type of argument
             should be passed as the first argument to the callback. A
             value of 'object' causes the results of `stmt.get({})` to
             be passed to the object. A value of 'array' causes the
             results of `stmt.get([])` to be passed to the callback.
             A value of 'stmt' is equivalent to the default, passing
             the current Stmt to the callback (noting that it's always
             passed as the 2nd argument). Any other value triggers an
             exception.

           - saveSql = an optional array. If set, the SQL of each
             executed statement is appended to this array before the
             statement is executed (but after it is prepared - we
             don't have the string until after that). Empty SQL
             statements are elided.

           ACHTUNG #1: The callback MUST NOT modify the Stmt
           object. Calling any of the Stmt.get() variants,
           Stmt.getColumnName(), or simililar, is legal, but calling
           step() or finalize() is not. Routines which are illegal
           in this context will trigger an exception.

           ACHTUNG #2: The semantics of the `bind` and `callback`
           options may well change or those options may be removed
           altogether for this function (but retained for exec()).

           If passed a single argument, it must be either an array, an
           object, or a value of a bindable type (see below).

           If passed 2 arguments, the first one is the 1-based bind
           index or bindable parameter name and the second one must be
           a value of a bindable type.

           Bindable value types:

           - null or undefined is bound as NULL.

           - Numbers are bound as either doubles or integers: doubles
             if they are larger than 32 bits, else double or int32,
             depending on whether they have a fractional part. (It is,
             as of this writing, illegal to call (from JS) a WASM
             function which either takes or returns an int64.)
             Booleans are bound as integer 0 or 1. It is not expected
             the distinction of binding doubles which have no
             fractional parts is integers is significant for the
             majority of clients due to sqlite3's data typing
             model. This API does not currently support the BigInt
             type.

           - Strings are bound as strings (use bindAsBlob() to force
             blob binding).

           - Uint8Array instances are bound as blobs.

           If passed an array, each element of the array is bound at
           the parameter index equal to the array index plus 1
           (because arrays are 0-based but binding is 1-based).

           If passed an object, each object key is treated as a
           bindable parameter name. The object keys _must_ match any
           bindable parameter names, including any `$`, `@`, or `:`
           prefix. Because `$` is a legal identifier chararacter in
           JavaScript, that is the suggested prefix for bindable
           parameters.

           It returns this object on success and throws on
           error. Errors include:

           - Any bind index is out of range, a named bind parameter
             does not match, or this statement has no bindable
             parameters.

           - Any value to bind is of an unsupported type.

           - Passed no arguments or more than two.

           - The statement has been finalized.

           By default it will determine the data type of the result

           undefined is the same as not passing a value. It is legal

           sqlite3 will convert the value to a string.

           If ndx is an array, this function behaves a differently: it
           assigns the indexes of the array, from 0 to the number of
           result columns, to the values of the corresponding column,
           and returns that array.

           If ndx is a plain object, this function behaves even
           differentlier: it assigns the properties of the object to
           the values of their corresponding result columns.

           Blobs are returned as Uint8Array instances.

           Potential TODO: add type ID SQLITE_JSON, which fetches the
           result as a string and passes it (if it's not null) to
           JSON.parse(), returning the result of that. Until then,
           getJSON() can be used for that.
