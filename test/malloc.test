# This file attempts to check the library in an out-of-memory situation.
# When compiled with -DMEMORY_DEBUG=1, the SQLite library accepts a special
# command (--malloc-fail=N) which causes the N-th malloc to fail.  This
# special feature is used to see what happens in the library if a malloc
# were to really fail due to an out-of-memory situation.
