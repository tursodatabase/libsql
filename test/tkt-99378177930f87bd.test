# This file implements regression tests for SQLite library.
#
# This file implements tests to verify that the enhancement
# request documented by ticket 99378177930f87bd is working.
#
# The enhancement is that if an aggregate query with a GROUP BY clause
# uses subexpressions in the arguments to aggregate functions that are
# also columns of an index, then the values are pulled from the index
# rather than being recomputed.  This has the potential to make some
# indexed queries works as if the index were covering.
