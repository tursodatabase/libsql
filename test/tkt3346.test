# Ticket #3530
#
# As shown by ticket #3346 above (see also ticket #3298) it is important
# that a subquery in the result-set be able to look up through multiple
# FROM levels in order to view tables in the FROM clause at the top level.
#
# But ticket #3530 shows us that a subquery in the FROM clause should not
# be able to look up to higher levels:
