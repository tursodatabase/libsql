# The following tests - server1-2.* - test the following scenario:
#
# 1:  Read-lock thread A
# 2:  Read-lock thread B
# 3:  Attempt to write in thread C -> SQLITE_BUSY
# 4:  Check db write failed from main thread.
# 5:  Unlock from thread A.
# 6:  Attempt to write in thread C -> SQLITE_BUSY
# 7:  Check db write failed from main thread.
# 8:  Unlock from thread B.
# 9:  Attempt to write in thread C -> SQLITE_DONE
# 10: Finalize the write from thread C
# 11: Check db write succeeded from main thread.
