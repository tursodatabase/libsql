** This is the implementation of the page cache subsystem or "pager".
** 
** The pager is used to access a database disk file.  It implements
** atomic commit and rollback through the use of a journal file that
** is separate from the database file.  The pager also implements file
** locking to prevent two processes from writing the same database
** file simultaneously, or one process from reading the database while
** another is writing.

/******************* NOTES ON THE DESIGN OF THE PAGER ************************
**
** This comment block describes invariants that hold when using a rollback
** journal.  These invariants do not apply for journal_mode=WAL,
** journal_mode=MEMORY, or journal_mode=OFF.
**
** Within this comment block, a page is deemed to have been synced
** automatically as soon as it is written when PRAGMA synchronous=OFF.
** Otherwise, the page is not synced until the xSync method of the VFS
** is called successfully on the file containing the page.
**
** Definition:  A page of the database file is said to be "overwriteable" if
** one or more of the following are true about the page:
** 
**     (a)  The original content of the page as it was at the beginning of
**          the transaction has been written into the rollback journal and
**          synced.
** 
**     (b)  The page was a freelist leaf page at the start of the transaction.
** 
**     (c)  The page number is greater than the largest page that existed in
**          the database file at the start of the transaction.
** 
** (1) A page of the database file is never overwritten unless one of the
**     following are true:
** 
**     (a) The page and all other pages on the same sector are overwriteable.
** 
**     (b) The atomic page write optimization is enabled, and the entire
**         transaction other than the update of the transaction sequence
**         number consists of a single page change.
** 
** (2) The content of a page written into the rollback journal exactly matches
**     both the content in the database when the rollback journal was written
**     and the content in the database at the beginning of the current
**     transaction.
** 
** (3) Writes to the database file are an integer multiple of the page size
**     in length and are aligned on a page boundary.
** 
** (4) Reads from the database file are either aligned on a page boundary and
**     an integer multiple of the page size in length or are taken from the
**     first 100 bytes of the database file.
** 
** (5) All writes to the database file are synced prior to the rollback journal
**     being deleted, truncated, or zeroed.
** 
** (6) If a super-journal file is used, then all writes to the database file
**     are synced prior to the super-journal being deleted.
** 
** Definition: Two databases (or the same database at two points it time)
** are said to be "logically equivalent" if they give the same answer to
** all queries.  Note in particular the content of freelist leaf
** pages can be changed arbitrarily without affecting the logical equivalence
** of the database.
** 
** (7) At any time, if any subset, including the empty set and the total set,
**     of the unsynced changes to a rollback journal are removed and the 
**     journal is rolled back, the resulting database file will be logically
**     equivalent to the database file at the beginning of the transaction.
** 
** (8) When a transaction is rolled back, the xTruncate method of the VFS
**     is called to restore the database file to the same size it was at
**     the beginning of the transaction.  (In some VFSes, the xTruncate
**     method is a no-op, but that does not change the fact the SQLite will
**     invoke it.)
** 
** (9) Whenever the database file is modified, at least one bit in the range
**     of bytes from 24 through 39 inclusive will be changed prior to releasing
**     the EXCLUSIVE lock, thus signaling other connections on the same
**     database to flush their caches.
**
** (10) The pattern of bits in bytes 24 through 39 shall not repeat in less
**      than one billion transactions.
**
** (11) A database file is well-formed at the beginning and at the conclusion
**      of every transaction.
**
** (12) An EXCLUSIVE lock is held on the database file when writing to
**      the database file.
**
** (13) A SHARED lock is held on the database file while reading any
**      content out of the database file.

**   ERROR             -> OPEN                [pager_unlock]
** 
**
**  OPEN:
**
**    The pager starts up in this state. Nothing is guaranteed in this
**    state - the file may or may not be locked and the database size is
**    unknown. The database may not be read or written.
**
**    * No read or write transaction is active.
**    * Any lock, or no lock at all, may be held on the database file.
**    * The dbSize, dbOrigSize and dbFileSize variables may not be trusted.
**
**  READER:
**
**    In this state all the requirements for reading the database in 
**    rollback (non-WAL) mode are met. Unless the pager is (or recently
**    was) in exclusive-locking mode, a user-level read transaction is 
**    open. The database size is known in this state.
**
**    A connection running with locking_mode=normal enters this state when
**    it opens a read-transaction on the database and returns to state
**    OPEN after the read-transaction is completed. However a connection
**    running in locking_mode=exclusive (including temp databases) remains in
**    this state even after the read-transaction is closed. The only way
**    a locking_mode=exclusive connection can transition from READER to OPEN
**    is via the ERROR state (see below).
** 
**    * A read transaction may be active (but a write-transaction cannot).
**    * A SHARED or greater lock is held on the database file.
**    * The dbSize variable may be trusted (even if a user-level read 
**      transaction is not active). The dbOrigSize and dbFileSize variables
**      may not be trusted at this point.
**    * If the database is a WAL database, then the WAL connection is open.
**    * Even if a read-transaction is not open, it is guaranteed that 
**      there is no hot-journal in the file-system.
**
**  WRITER_LOCKED:
**
**    The pager moves to this state from READER when a write-transaction
**    is first opened on the database. In WRITER_LOCKED state, all locks 
**    required to start a write-transaction are held, but no actual 
**    modifications to the cache or database have taken place.
**
**    In rollback mode, a RESERVED or (if the transaction was opened with 
**    BEGIN EXCLUSIVE) EXCLUSIVE lock is obtained on the database file when
**    moving to this state, but the journal file is not written to or opened 
**    to in this state. If the transaction is committed or rolled back while 
**    in WRITER_LOCKED state, all that is required is to unlock the database 
**    file.
**
**    IN WAL mode, WalBeginWriteTransaction() is called to lock the log file.
**    If the connection is running with locking_mode=exclusive, an attempt
**    is made to obtain an EXCLUSIVE lock on the database file.
**
**    * A write transaction is active.
**    * If the connection is open in rollback-mode, a RESERVED or greater 
**      lock is held on the database file.
**    * If the connection is open in WAL-mode, a WAL write transaction
**      is open (i.e. sqlite3WalBeginWriteTransaction() has been successfully
**      called).
**    * The dbSize, dbOrigSize and dbFileSize variables are all valid.
**    * The contents of the pager cache have not been modified.
**    * The journal file may or may not be open.
**    * Nothing (not even the first header) has been written to the journal.
**
**  WRITER_CACHEMOD:
**
**    A pager moves from WRITER_LOCKED state to this state when a page is
**    first modified by the upper layer. In rollback mode the journal file
**    is opened (if it is not already open) and a header written to the
**    start of it. The database file on disk has not been modified.
**
**    * A write transaction is active.
**    * A RESERVED or greater lock is held on the database file.
**    * The journal file is open and the first header has been written 
**      to it, but the header has not been synced to disk.
**    * The contents of the page cache have been modified.
**
**  WRITER_DBMOD:
**
**    The pager transitions from WRITER_CACHEMOD into WRITER_DBMOD state
**    when it modifies the contents of the database file. WAL connections
**    never enter this state (since they do not modify the database file,
**    just the log file).
**
**    * A write transaction is active.
**    * An EXCLUSIVE or greater lock is held on the database file.
**    * The journal file is open and the first header has been written 
**      and synced to disk.
**    * The contents of the page cache have been modified (and possibly
**      written to disk).
**
**  WRITER_FINISHED:
**
**    It is not possible for a WAL connection to enter this state.
**
**    A rollback-mode pager changes to WRITER_FINISHED state from WRITER_DBMOD
**    state after the entire transaction has been successfully written into the
**    database file. In this state the transaction may be committed simply
**    by finalizing the journal file. Once in WRITER_FINISHED state, it is 
**    not possible to modify the database further. At this point, the upper 
**    layer must either commit or rollback the transaction.
**
**    * A write transaction is active.
**    * An EXCLUSIVE or greater lock is held on the database file.
**    * All writing and syncing of journal and database data has finished.
**      If no error occurred, all that remains is to finalize the journal to
**      commit the transaction. If an error did occur, the caller will need
**      to rollback the transaction. 
**
**  ERROR:
**
**    The ERROR state is entered when an IO or disk-full error (including
**    SQLITE_IOERR_NOMEM) occurs at a point in the code that makes it 
**    difficult to be sure that the in-memory pager state (cache contents, 
**    db size etc.) are consistent with the contents of the file-system.
**
**    Temporary pager files may enter the ERROR state, but in-memory pagers
**    cannot.
**
**    For example, if an IO error occurs while performing a rollback, 
**    the contents of the page-cache may be left in an inconsistent state.
**    At this point it would be dangerous to change back to READER state
**    (as usually happens after a rollback). Any subsequent readers might
**    report database corruption (due to the inconsistent cache), and if
**    they upgrade to writers, they may inadvertently corrupt the database
**    file. To avoid this hazard, the pager switches into the ERROR state
**    instead of READER following such an error.
**
**    Once it has entered the ERROR state, any attempt to use the pager
**    to read or write data returns an error. Eventually, once all 
**    outstanding transactions have been abandoned, the pager is able to
**    transition back to OPEN state, discarding the contents of the 
**    page-cache and any other in-memory state at the same time. Everything
**    is reloaded from disk (and, if necessary, hot-journal rollback peformed)
**    when a read-transaction is next opened on the pager (transitioning
**    the pager into READER state). At that point the system has recovered 
**    from the error.
**
**    Specifically, the pager jumps into the ERROR state if:
**
**      1. An error occurs while attempting a rollback. This happens in
**         function sqlite3PagerRollback().
**
**      2. An error occurs while attempting to finalize a journal file
**         following a commit in function sqlite3PagerCommitPhaseTwo().
**
**      3. An error occurs while attempting to write to the journal or
**         database file in function pagerStress() in order to free up
**         memory.
**
**    In other cases, the error is returned to the b-tree layer. The b-tree
**    layer then attempts a rollback operation. If the error condition 
**    persists, the pager enters the ERROR state via condition (1) above.
**
**    Condition (3) is necessary because it can be triggered by a read-only
**    statement executed within a transaction. In this case, if the error
**    code were simply returned to the user, the b-tree layer would not
**    automatically attempt a rollback, as it assumes that an error in a
**    read-only statement cannot leave the pager in an internally inconsistent 
**    state.
**
**    * The Pager.errCode variable is set to something other than SQLITE_OK.
**    * There are one or more outstanding references to pages (after the
**      last reference is dropped the pager should move back to OPEN state).
**    * The pager is not an in-memory pager.
**    
**
** Notes:
**
**   * A pager is never in WRITER_DBMOD or WRITER_FINISHED state if the
**     connection is open in WAL mode. A WAL connection is always in one
**     of the first four states.
**
**   * Normally, a connection open in exclusive mode is never in PAGER_OPEN
**     state. There are two exceptions: immediately after exclusive-mode has
**     been turned on (and before any read or write transactions are 
**     executed), and when the pager is leaving the "error state".
**
**   * See also: assert_pager_state().

/*
** The Pager.eLock variable is almost always set to one of the 
** following locking-states, according to the lock currently held on
** the database file: NO_LOCK, SHARED_LOCK, RESERVED_LOCK or EXCLUSIVE_LOCK.
** This variable is kept up to date as locks are taken and released by
** the pagerLockDb() and pagerUnlockDb() wrappers.
**
** If the VFS xLock() or xUnlock() returns an error other than SQLITE_BUSY
** (i.e. one of the SQLITE_IOERR subtypes), it is not clear whether or not
** the operation was successful. In these circumstances pagerLockDb() and
** pagerUnlockDb() take a conservative approach - eLock is always updated
** when unlocking the file, and only updated when locking the file if the
** VFS call is successful. This way, the Pager.eLock variable may be set
** to a less exclusive (lower) value than the lock that is actually held
** at the system level, but it is never set to a more exclusive value.
**
** This is usually safe. If an xUnlock fails or appears to fail, there may 
** be a few redundant xLock() calls or a lock may be held for longer than
** required, but nothing really goes wrong.
**
** The exception is when the database file is unlocked as the pager moves
** from ERROR to OPEN state. At this point there may be a hot-journal file 
** in the file-system that needs to be rolled back (as part of an OPEN->SHARED
** transition, by the same pager or any other). If the call to xUnlock()
** fails at this point and the pager is left holding an EXCLUSIVE lock, this
** can confuse the call to xCheckReservedLock() call made later as part
** of hot-journal detection.
**
** xCheckReservedLock() is defined as returning true "if there is a RESERVED 
** lock held by this process or any others". So xCheckReservedLock may 
** return true because the caller itself is holding an EXCLUSIVE lock (but
** doesn't know it because of a previous error in xUnlock). If this happens
** a hot-journal may be mistaken for a journal being created by an active
** transaction in another process, causing SQLite to read from the database
** without rolling it back.
**
** To work around this, if a call to xUnlock() fails when unlocking the
** database in the ERROR state, Pager.eLock is set to UNKNOWN_LOCK. It
** is only changed back to a real locking state after a successful call
** to xLock(EXCLUSIVE). Also, the code to do the OPEN->SHARED state transition
** omits the check for a hot-journal if Pager.eLock is set to UNKNOWN_LOCK 
** lock. Instead, it assumes a hot-journal exists and obtains an EXCLUSIVE
** lock on the database file before attempting to roll it back. See function
** PagerSharedLock() for more detail.
**
** Pager.eLock may only be set to UNKNOWN_LOCK when the pager is in 
** PAGER_OPEN state.

/*
** An open page cache is an instance of struct Pager. A description of
** some of the more important member variables follows:
**
** eState
**
**   The current 'state' of the pager object. See the comment and state
**   diagram above for a description of the pager state.
**
** eLock
**
**   For a real on-disk database, the current lock held on the database file -
**   NO_LOCK, SHARED_LOCK, RESERVED_LOCK or EXCLUSIVE_LOCK.
**
**   For a temporary or in-memory database (neither of which require any
**   locks), this variable is always set to EXCLUSIVE_LOCK. Since such
**   databases always have Pager.exclusiveMode==1, this tricks the pager
**   logic into thinking that it already has all the locks it will ever
**   need (and no reason to release them).
**
**   In some (obscure) circumstances, this variable may also be set to
**   UNKNOWN_LOCK. See the comment above the #define of UNKNOWN_LOCK for
**   details.
**
** changeCountDone
**
**   This boolean variable is used to make sure that the change-counter 
**   (the 4-byte header field at byte offset 24 of the database file) is 
**   not updated more often than necessary. 
**
**   It is set to true when the change-counter field is updated, which 
**   can only happen if an exclusive lock is held on the database file.
**   It is cleared (set to false) whenever an exclusive lock is 
**   relinquished on the database file. Each time a transaction is committed,
**   The changeCountDone flag is inspected. If it is true, the work of
**   updating the change-counter is omitted for the current transaction.
**
**   This mechanism means that when running in exclusive mode, a connection 
**   need only update the change-counter once, for the first transaction
**   committed.
**
** setSuper
**
**   When PagerCommitPhaseOne() is called to commit a transaction, it may
**   (or may not) specify a super-journal name to be written into the 
**   journal file before it is synced to disk.
**
**   Whether or not a journal file contains a super-journal pointer affects 
**   the way in which the journal file is finalized after the transaction is 
**   committed or rolled back when running in "journal_mode=PERSIST" mode.
**   If a journal file does not contain a super-journal pointer, it is
**   finalized by overwriting the first journal header with zeroes. If
**   it does contain a super-journal pointer the journal file is finalized 
**   by truncating it to zero bytes, just as if the connection were 
**   running in "journal_mode=truncate" mode.
**
**   Journal files that contain super-journal pointers cannot be finalized
**   simply by overwriting the first journal-header with zeroes, as the
**   super-journal pointer could interfere with hot-journal rollback of any
**   subsequently interrupted transaction that reuses the journal file.
**
**   The flag is cleared as soon as the journal file is finalized (either
**   by PagerCommitPhaseTwo or PagerRollback). If an IO error prevents the
**   journal file from being successfully finalized, the setSuper flag
**   is cleared anyway (and the pager will move to ERROR state).
**
** doNotSpill
**
**   This variables control the behavior of cache-spills  (calls made by
**   the pcache module to the pagerStress() routine to write cached data
**   to the file-system in order to free up memory).
**
**   When bits SPILLFLAG_OFF or SPILLFLAG_ROLLBACK of doNotSpill are set,
**   writing to the database from pagerStress() is disabled altogether.
**   The SPILLFLAG_ROLLBACK case is done in a very obscure case that
**   comes up during savepoint rollback that requires the pcache module
**   to allocate a new page to prevent the journal file from being written
**   while it is being traversed by code in pager_playback().  The SPILLFLAG_OFF
**   case is a user preference.
** 
**   If the SPILLFLAG_NOSYNC bit is set, writing to the database from
**   pagerStress() is permitted, but syncing the journal file is not.
**   This flag is set by sqlite3PagerWrite() when the file-system sector-size
**   is larger than the database page-size in order to prevent a journal sync
**   from happening in between the journalling of two pages on the same sector. 
**
** subjInMemory
**
**   This is a boolean variable. If true, then any required sub-journal
**   is opened as an in-memory journal file. If false, then in-memory
**   sub-journals are only used for in-memory pager files.
**
**   This variable is updated by the upper layer each time a new 
**   write-transaction is opened.
**
** dbSize, dbOrigSize, dbFileSize
**
**   Variable dbSize is set to the number of pages in the database file.
**   It is valid in PAGER_READER and higher states (all states except for
**   OPEN and ERROR). 
**
**   dbSize is set based on the size of the database file, which may be 
**   larger than the size of the database (the value stored at offset
**   28 of the database header by the btree). If the size of the file
**   is not an integer multiple of the page-size, the value stored in
**   dbSize is rounded down (i.e. a 5KB file with 2K page-size has dbSize==2).
**   Except, any file that is greater than 0 bytes in size is considered
**   to have at least one page. (i.e. a 1KB file with 2K page-size leads
**   to dbSize==1).
**
**   During a write-transaction, if pages with page-numbers greater than
**   dbSize are modified in the cache, dbSize is updated accordingly.
**   Similarly, if the database is truncated using PagerTruncateImage(), 
**   dbSize is updated.
**
**   Variables dbOrigSize and dbFileSize are valid in states 
**   PAGER_WRITER_LOCKED and higher. dbOrigSize is a copy of the dbSize
**   variable at the start of the transaction. It is used during rollback,
**   and to determine whether or not pages need to be journalled before
**   being modified.
**
**   Throughout a write-transaction, dbFileSize contains the size of
**   the file on disk in pages. It is set to a copy of dbSize when the
**   write-transaction is first opened, and updated when VFS calls are made
**   to write or truncate the database file on disk. 
**
**   The only reason the dbFileSize variable is required is to suppress 
**   unnecessary calls to xTruncate() after committing a transaction. If, 
**   when a transaction is committed, the dbFileSize variable indicates 
**   that the database file is larger than the database image (Pager.dbSize), 
**   pager_truncate() is called. The pager_truncate() call uses xFilesize()
**   to measure the database file on disk, and then truncates it if required.
**   dbFileSize is not used when rolling back a transaction. In this case
**   pager_truncate() is called unconditionally (which means there may be
**   a call to xFilesize() that is not strictly required). In either case,
**   pager_truncate() may cause the file to become smaller or larger.
**
** dbHintSize
**
**   The dbHintSize variable is used to limit the number of calls made to
**   the VFS xFileControl(FCNTL_SIZE_HINT) method. 
**
**   dbHintSize is set to a copy of the dbSize variable when a
**   write-transaction is opened (at the same time as dbFileSize and
**   dbOrigSize). If the xFileControl(FCNTL_SIZE_HINT) method is called,
**   dbHintSize is increased to the number of pages that correspond to the
**   size-hint passed to the method call. See pager_write_pagelist() for 
**   details.
**
** errCode
**
**   The Pager.errCode variable is only ever used in PAGER_ERROR state. It
**   is set to zero in all other states. In PAGER_ERROR state, Pager.errCode 
**   is always set to SQLITE_FULL, SQLITE_IOERR or one of the SQLITE_IOERR_XXX 
**   sub-codes.
**
** syncFlags, walSyncFlags
**
**   syncFlags is either SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL (0x02) or SQLITE_SYNC_FULL (0x03).
**   syncFlags is used for rollback mode.  walSyncFlags is used for WAL mode
**   and contains the flags used to sync the checkpoint operations in the
**   lower two bits, and sync flags used for transaction commits in the WAL
**   file in bits 0x04 and 0x08.  In other words, to get the correct sync flags
**   for checkpoint operations, use (walSyncFlags&0x03) and to get the correct
**   sync flags for transaction commit, use ((walSyncFlags>>2)&0x03).  Note
**   that with synchronous=NORMAL in WAL mode, transaction commit is not synced
**   meaning that the 0x04 and 0x08 bits are both zero.

**

** file has been finalized it is not possible to use it to roll back a 
** transaction. Nor will it be considered to be a hot-journal by this
** or any other database connection. Exactly how a journal is finalized
** depends on whether or not the pager is running in exclusive mode and
** the current journal-mode (Pager.journalMode value), as follows:
**
**   journalMode==MEMORY
**     Journal file descriptor is simply closed. This destroys an 
**     in-memory journal.
**
**   journalMode==TRUNCATE
**     Journal file is truncated to zero bytes in size.
**
**   journalMode==PERSIST
**     The first 28 bytes of the journal file are zeroed. This invalidates
**     the first journal header in the file, and hence the entire journal
**     file. An invalid journal file cannot be rolled back.
**
**   journalMode==DELETE
**     The journal file is closed and deleted using sqlite3OsDelete().
**
**     If the pager is running in exclusive mode, this method of finalizing
**     the journal file is never used. Instead, if the journalMode is
**     DELETE and the pager is in exclusive mode, the method described under
**     journalMode==PERSIST is used instead.
**
** After the journal is finalized, the pager moves to PAGER_READER state.
** If running in non-exclusive rollback mode, the lock on the file is 
** downgraded to a SHARED_LOCK.
**
** SQLITE_OK is returned if no error occurs. If an error occurs during
** any of the IO operations to finalize the journal file or unlock the
** database then the IO error code is returned to the user. If the 
** operation to finalize the journal file fails, then the code still
** tries to unlock the database file if not in exclusive mode. If the
** unlock operation fails as well, then the first error code related
** to the first error encountered (the journal finalization one) is
** returned.

**  (3)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the initial value for the 
**       sanity checksum.
**  (4)  4 byte integer which is the number of pages to truncate the
**       database to during a rollback.
**  (5)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the sector size.  The header
**       is this many bytes in size.
**  (6)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the page size.
**  (7)  zero padding out to the next sector size.
**  (8)  Zero or more pages instances, each as follows:
**        +  4 byte page number.
**        +  pPager->pageSize bytes of data.
**        +  4 byte checksum
**
** When we speak of the journal header, we mean the first 7 items above.
** Each entry in the journal is an instance of the 8th item.

** valid page entries in the journal.  In most cases, you can compute the
** value of nRec from the size of the journal file.  But if a power
** failure occurred while the journal was being written, it could be the
** case that the size of the journal file had already been increased but
** the extra entries had not yet made it safely to disk.  In such a case,
** the value of nRec computed from the file size would be too large.  For
** that reason, we always use the nRec value in the header.
**
** If the nRec value is 0xffffffff it means that nRec should be computed
** from the file size.  This value is used when the user selects the
** no-sync option for the journal.  A power failure could lead to corruption
** in this case.  But for things like temporary table (which will be

** The "level" in pgFlags & PAGER_SYNCHRONOUS_MASK sets the robustness
** of the database to damage due to OS crashes or power failures by
** changing the number of syncs()s when writing the journals.
** There are four levels:
**
**    OFF       sqlite3OsSync() is never called.  This is the default
**              for temporary and transient files.
**
**    NORMAL    The journal is synced once before writes begin on the
**              database.  This is normally adequate protection, but
**              it is theoretically possible, though very unlikely,
**              that an inopertune power failure could leave the journal
**              in a state which would cause damage to the database
**              when it is rolled back.
**
**    FULL      The journal is synced twice before writes begin on the
**              database (with some additional information - the nRec field
**              of the journal header - being written in between the two
**              syncs).  If we assume that writing a
**              single disk sector is atomic, then this mode provides
**              assurance that the journal will not be corrupted to the
**              point of causing damage to the database during rollback.
**
**    EXTRA     This is like FULL except that is also syncs the directory
**              that contains the rollback journal after the rollback
**              journal is unlinked.
**
** The above is for a rollback-journal mode.  For WAL mode, OFF continues
** to mean that no syncs ever occur.  NORMAL means that the WAL is synced
** prior to the start of checkpoint and that the database file is synced
** at the conclusion of the checkpoint if the entire content of the WAL
** was written back into the database.  But no sync operations occur for
** an ordinary commit in NORMAL mode with WAL.  FULL means that the WAL
** file is synced following each commit operation, in addition to the
** syncs associated with NORMAL.  There is no difference between FULL
** and EXTRA for WAL mode.
**
** Do not confuse synchronous=FULL with SQLITE_SYNC_FULL.  The
** SQLITE_SYNC_FULL macro means to use the MacOSX-style full-fsync
** using fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC).  SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL means to do an
** ordinary fsync() call.  There is no difference between SQLITE_SYNC_FULL
** and SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL on platforms other than MacOSX.  But the
** synchronous=FULL versus synchronous=NORMAL setting determines when
** the xSync primitive is called and is relevant to all platforms.
**
** Numeric values associated with these states are OFF==1, NORMAL=2,
** and FULL=3.

** This function is called after transitioning from PAGER_UNLOCK to

**
**   * The journal file exists in the file system, and
**   * No process holds a RESERVED or greater lock on the database file, and
**   * The database file itself is greater than 0 bytes in size, and
**   * The first byte of the journal file exists and is not 0x00.
**
** If the current size of the database file is 0 but a journal file
** exists, that is probably an old journal left over from a prior

** just deleted using OsDelete, *pExists is set to 0 and SQLITE_OK
** is returned.

** does not exist, then the journal file is not really hot. In this
** case this routine will return a false-positive. The pager_playback()
** routine will discover that the journal file is not really hot and 
** will not roll it back. 
**

** Otherwise, a new page object is allocated and populated with data
** read from the database file. In some cases, the pcache module may
** choose not to allocate a new page object and may reuse an existing
** object with no outstanding references.
**
** The extra data appended to a page is always initialized to zeros the 
** first time a page is loaded into memory. If the page requested is 
** already in the cache when this function is called, then the extra
** data is left as it was when the page object was last used.
**
** If the database image is smaller than the requested page or if 
** the flags parameter contains the PAGER_GET_NOCONTENT bit and the 
** requested page is not already stored in the cache, then no 
** actual disk read occurs. In this case the memory image of the 
** page is initialized to all zeros. 
**
** If PAGER_GET_NOCONTENT is true, it means that we do not care about
** the contents of the page. This occurs in two scenarios:
**
**   a) When reading a free-list leaf page from the database, and
**
**   b) When a savepoint is being rolled back and we need to load
**      a new page into the cache to be filled with the data read
**      from the savepoint journal.
**
** If PAGER_GET_NOCONTENT is true, then the data returned is zeroed instead
** of being read from the database. Additionally, the bits corresponding
** to pgno in Pager.pInJournal (bitvec of pages already written to the
** journal file) and the PagerSavepoint.pInSavepoint bitvecs of any open
** savepoints are set. This means if the page is made writable at any
** point in the future, using a call to sqlite3PagerWrite(), its contents
** will not be journaled. This saves IO.
**
** The acquisition might fail for several reasons.  In all cases,
** an appropriate error code is returned and *ppPage is set to NULL.
**
** See also sqlite3PagerLookup().  Both this routine and Lookup() attempt
** to find a page in the in-memory cache first.  If the page is not already
** in memory, this routine goes to disk to read it in whereas Lookup()
** just returns 0.  This routine acquires a read-lock the first time it
** has to go to disk, and could also playback an old journal if necessary.
** Since Lookup() never goes to disk, it never has to deal with locks
** or journal files.
