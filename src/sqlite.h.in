** CAPI3REF: Compile-Time Library Version Numbers
**
** The version of the SQLite library is contained in the sqlite3.h
** header file in a #define named SQLITE_VERSION.  The SQLITE_VERSION
** macro resolves to a string constant.
**
** The format of the version string is "X.Y.Z", where
** X is the major version number, Y is the minor version number and Z
** is the release number.  The X.Y.Z might be followed by "alpha" or "beta".
** For example "3.1.1beta".
**
** The X value is always 3 in SQLite.  The X value only changes when
** backwards compatibility is broken and we intend to never break
** backwards compatibility.  The Y value only changes when
** there are major feature enhancements that are forwards compatible
** but not backwards compatible.  The Z value is incremented with
** each release but resets back to 0 when Y is incremented.
**
** The SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER is an integer with the value 
** (X*1000000 + Y*1000 + Z). For example, for version "3.1.1beta", 
** SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER is set to 3001001. To detect if they are using 
** version 3.1.1 or greater at compile time, programs may use the test 
** (SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER>=3001001).

/*
** CAPI3REF: One-Step Query Execution Interface
**
** This interface is used to do a one-time evaluatation of zero

** be evaluted is passed in as the second parameter.  The statements
** are prepared one by one using [sqlite3_prepare()], evaluated
** using [sqlite3_step()], then destroyed using [sqlite3_finalize()].
**
** If one or more of the SQL statements are queries, then
** the callback function specified by the 3rd parameter is
** invoked once for each row of the query result.  This callback
** should normally return 0.  If the callback returns a non-zero
** value then the query is aborted, all subsequent SQL statements
** are skipped and the sqlite3_exec() function returns the SQLITE_ABORT.
**
** The 4th parameter to this interface is an arbitrary pointer that is
** passed through to the callback function as its first parameter.
**
** The 2nd parameter to the callback function is the number of
** columns in the query result.  The 3rd parameter to the callback
** is an array of strings holding the values for each column
** as extracted using [sqlite3_column_text()].
** The 4th parameter to the callback is an array of strings
** obtained using [sqlite3_column_name()] and holding
** the names of each column.
**
** The callback function may be NULL, even for queries.  A NULL
** callback is not an error.  It just means that no callback
** will be invoked.
**
** If an error occurs while parsing or evaluating the SQL (but
** not while executing the callback) then an appropriate error
** message is written into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()] and
** *errmsg is made to point to that message.  The calling function
** is responsible for freeing the memory that holds the error
** message.   Use [sqlite3_free()] for this.  If errmsg==NULL,
** then no error message is ever written.
**
** The return value is is SQLITE_OK if there are no errors and
** some other [SQLITE_OK | return code] if there is an error.  
** The particular return value depends on the type of error.

** CAPI3REF: Extended Result Codes
**
** In its default configuration, SQLite API routines return one of 26 integer
** result codes described at result-codes.  However, experience has shown that
** many of these result codes are too course-grained.  They do not provide as
** much information about problems as users might like.  In an effort to
** address this, newer versions of SQLite (version 3.3.8 and later) include
** support for additional result codes that provide more detailed information
** about errors.  The extended result codes are enabled (or disabled) for 
** each database
** connection using the [sqlite3_extended_result_codes()] API.
** 
** Some of the available extended result codes are listed above.
** We expect the number of extended result codes will be expand
** over time.  Software that uses extended result codes should expect
** to see new result codes in future releases of SQLite.
** 
** The symbolic name for an extended result code always contains a related
** primary result code as a prefix.  Primary result codes contain a single
** "_" character.  Extended result codes contain two or more "_" characters.
** The numeric value of an extended result code can be converted to its
** corresponding primary result code by masking off the lower 8 bytes.
**
** The SQLITE_OK result code will never be extended.  It will always
** be exactly zero.

**
** The flags argument to xSync may be one of SQLITE_SYNC_BARRIER,

** 
** The integer values to xLock() and xUnlock() are one of
** SQLITE_LOCK_NONE, SQLITE_LOCK_READ, SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED,
** SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING, or SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE.  xLock()
** increases the lock. xUnlock() decreases the lock.

** 
** xBreakLock() attempts to break a lock held by another process.
** This can be used to remove a stale dot-file lock, for example.
** It returns 0 on success and non-zero for a failure.
**
** The xSectorSize() method returns the sector size of the

** minimum write that can be performed without disturbing
** other bytes in the file.  The xDeviceCharacteristics()
** method returns a bit vector describing behaviors of the

/*
** CAPI3REF: OS Interface Object
**
** An instance of this object defines the interface between the
** SQLite core and the underlying operating system.  The "vfs"
** in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".
**
** The iVersion field is initially 1 but may be larger for future
** versions.  szOsFile is the size of the subclassed sqlite3_file
** structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
** a pathname in this VFS.
**
** The nRef field is incremented and decremented by SQLite to keep
** count of the number of users of the VFS.  This field and
** vfsMutex, pNext, and pPrev are the only fields in the sqlite3_vfs 
** structure that SQLite will ever modify.  These fields are modified 
** within an sqlite3_mutex_serialize() call so that updates are threadsafe.
** 
** The sqlite3_vfs.vfsMutex is a mutex used by the OS interface.
** It should initially be NULL.  SQLite will initialize this field
** using sqlite3_mutex_allocate() upon first use of the adaptor
** by sqlite3_open_v2() and will deallocate the mutex when the
** last user closes.  In other words, vfsMutex will be allocated
** when nRef transitions from 0 to 1 and will be deallocated when
** nRef transitions from 1 to 0.
**
** Registered vfs modules are kept on a linked list formed by
** the pNext and pPrev pointers.  The [sqlite3_register_vfs()]
** and [sqlite3_unregister_vfs()] interfaces manage this list
** in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_find_vfs()] searches the
** list.
**
** The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
** be unique across all VFS modules.
**
** SQLite will guarantee that the zFilename string passed to
** xOpen() is a full pathname as generated by xFullPathname() and
** that the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
** called.  So the sqlite3_file can store a pointer to the
** filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
**
** The flags argument to xOpen() is a copy of the flags argument
** to sqlite3_open_v2().  If sqlite3_open() or sqlite3_open16()
** is used, then flags is SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE | SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE.
** If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
** include SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY.  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be
** set.
** 
** SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
** call, depending on the object being opened:
** 
** <ul>
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MASTER_JOURNAL]
** </ul>
**
** The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
** changes the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
** that does not care about crash recovery or rollback, might make
** the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal are
** also a no-op.  Any attempt to read the journal return SQLITE_IOERR.
** Or the implementation might recognize the a database file will
** be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random order
** and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
** 
** SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen
** method:
** 
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
** </ul>
** 
** The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
** deleted when it is closed.  This will always be set for TEMP

** CAPI3REF: Register A Callback To Handle SQLITE_BUSY Errors
**
** This routine identifies a callback function that might be invoked
** whenever an attempt is made to open a database table 
** that another thread or process has locked.
** If the busy callback is NULL, then [SQLITE_BUSY]
** (or sometimes [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED])
** is returned immediately upon encountering the lock.
** If the busy callback is not NULL, then the
** callback will be invoked with two arguments.  The
** first argument to the handler is a copy of the void* pointer which
** is the third argument to this routine.  The second argument to
** the handler is the number of times that the busy handler has
** been invoked for this locking event. If the
** busy callback returns 0, then no additional attempts are made to
** access the database and [SQLITE_BUSY] or [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED] is returned.
** If the callback returns non-zero, then another attempt is made to open the
** database for reading and the cycle repeats.
**
** The presence of a busy handler does not guarantee that
** it will be invoked when there is lock contention.
** If SQLite determines that invoking the busy handler could result in
** a deadlock, it will return [SQLITE_BUSY] instead.
** Consider a scenario where one process is holding a read lock that
** it is trying to promote to a reserved lock and
** a second process is holding a reserved lock that it is trying
** to promote to an exclusive lock.  The first process cannot proceed
** because it is blocked by the second and the second process cannot
** proceed because it is blocked by the first.  If both processes
** invoke the busy handlers, neither will make any progress.  Therefore,
** SQLite returns [SQLITE_BUSY] for the first process, hoping that this
** will induce the first process to release its read lock and allow
** the second process to proceed.
**
** The default busy callback is NULL.
**
** The [SQLITE_BUSY] error is converted to [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED] when
** SQLite is in the middle of a large transaction where all the
** changes will not fit into the in-memory cache.  SQLite will
** already hold a RESERVED lock on the database file, but it needs
** to promote this lock to EXCLUSIVE so that it can spill cache
** pages into the database file without harm to concurrent
** readers.  If it is unable to promote the lock, then the in-memory
** cache will be left in an inconsistent state and so the error
** code is promoted from the relatively benign [SQLITE_BUSY] to
** the more severe [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED].  This error code promotion
** forces an automatic rollback of the changes. See the
** <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=CorruptionFollowingBusyError">
** CorruptionFollowingBusyError</a> wiki page for a discussion of why
** this is important.
**	
** Sqlite is re-entrant, so the busy handler may start a new query. 
** (It is not clear why anyone would every want to do this, but it
** is allowed, in theory.)  But the busy handler may not close the
** database.  Closing the database from a busy handler will delete 
** data structures out from under the executing query and will 
** probably result in a segmentation fault or other runtime error.
**
** There can only be a single busy handler defined for each database
** connection.  Setting a new busy handler clears any previous one.

/*
** CAPI3REF: Convenience Routines For Running Queries
**
** This next routine is a convenience wrapper around [sqlite3_exec()].
** Instead of invoking a user-supplied callback for each row of the
** result, this routine remembers each row of the result in memory
** obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()], then returns all of the result after the
** query has finished. 
**
** As an example, suppose the query result where this table:
**
** <pre>
**        Name        | Age
**        -----------------------
**        Alice       | 43
**        Bob         | 28
**        Cindy       | 21
** </pre>
**
** If the 3rd argument were &azResult then after the function returns
** azResult will contain the following data:
**
** <pre>
**        azResult[0] = "Name";
**        azResult[1] = "Age";
**        azResult[2] = "Alice";
**        azResult[3] = "43";
**        azResult[4] = "Bob";
**        azResult[5] = "28";
**        azResult[6] = "Cindy";
**        azResult[7] = "21";
** </pre>
**
** Notice that there is an extra row of data containing the column
** headers.  But the *nrow return value is still 3.  *ncolumn is
** set to 2.  In general, the number of values inserted into azResult
** will be ((*nrow) + 1)*(*ncolumn).
**
** After the calling function has finished using the result, it should 
** pass the result data pointer to sqlite3_free_table() in order to 
** release the memory that was malloc-ed.  Because of the way the 
** [sqlite3_malloc()] happens, the calling function must not try to call 
** [sqlite3_free()] directly.  Only [sqlite3_free_table()] is able to release 
** the memory properly and safely.
**
** The return value of this routine is the same as from [sqlite3_exec()].

/*
** CAPI3REF: Formatted String Printing Functions
**
** These routines are workalikes of the "printf()" family of functions
** from the standard C library.
**
** The sqlite3_mprintf() and sqlite3_vmprintf() routines write their
** results into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].
** The strings returned by these two routines should be
** released by [sqlite3_free()].  Both routines return a
** NULL pointer if [sqlite3_malloc()] is unable to allocate enough
** memory to hold the resulting string.
**
** In sqlite3_snprintf() routine is similar to "snprintf()" from
** the standard C library.  The result is written into the
** buffer supplied as the second parameter whose size is given by
** the first parameter.  Note that the order of the
** first two parameters is reversed from snprintf().  This is an
** historical accident that cannot be fixed without breaking
** backwards compatibility.  Note also that sqlite3_snprintf()
** returns a pointer to its buffer instead of the number of
** characters actually written into the buffer.  We admit that
** the number of characters written would be a more useful return
** value but we cannot change the implementation of sqlite3_snprintf()
** now without breaking compatibility.
**
** As long as the buffer size is greater than zero, sqlite3_snprintf()
** guarantees that the buffer is always zero-terminated.  The first
** parameter "n" is the total size of the buffer, including space for
** the zero terminator.  So the longest string that can be completely
** written will be n-1 characters.
**
** These routines all implement some additional formatting
** options that are useful for constructing SQL statements.
** All of the usual printf formatting options apply.  In addition, there
** is are "%q" and "%Q" options.
**
** The %q option works like %s in that it substitutes a null-terminated
** string from the argument list.  But %q also doubles every '\'' character.
** %q is designed for use inside a string literal.  By doubling each '\''
** character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into
** the string.
**
** For example, so some string variable contains text as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zText = "It's a happy day!";
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** One can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES('%q')", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** Because the %q format string is used, the '\'' character in zText
** is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It''s a happy day!')
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL
** would have looked like this:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It's a happy day!');
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This second example is an SQL syntax error.  As a general rule you
** should always use %q instead of %s when inserting text into a string 
** literal.
**
** The %Q option works like %q except it also adds single quotes around
** the outside of the total string.  Or if the parameter in the argument
** list is a NULL pointer, %Q substitutes the text "NULL" (without single
** quotes) in place of the %Q option.  So, for example, one could say:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES(%Q)", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** The code above will render a correct SQL statement in the zSQL
** variable even if the zText variable is a NULL pointer.

** [sqlite3_prepare16()] and [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()].  At various
** points during the compilation process, as logic is being created
** to perform various actions, the authorizer callback is invoked to
** see if those actions are allowed.  The authorizer callback should
** return SQLITE_OK to allow the action, [SQLITE_IGNORE] to disallow the
** specific action but allow the SQL statement to continue to be
** compiled, or [SQLITE_DENY] to cause the entire SQL statement to be
** rejected with an error.  
**
** Depending on the action, the [SQLITE_IGNORE] and [SQLITE_DENY] return
** codes might mean something different or they might mean the same
** thing.  If the action is, for example, to perform a delete opertion,
** then [SQLITE_IGNORE] and [SQLITE_DENY] both cause the statement compilation
** to fail with an error.  But if the action is to read a specific column
** from a specific table, then [SQLITE_DENY] will cause the entire
** statement to fail but [SQLITE_IGNORE] will cause a NULL value to be
** read instead of the actual column value.
**
** The first parameter to the authorizer callback is a copy of
** the third parameter to the sqlite3_set_authorizer() interface.
** The second parameter to the callback is an integer 
** [SQLITE_COPY | action code] that specifies the particular action
** to be authorized.  The available action codes are
** [SQLITE_COPY | documented separately].  The third through sixth
** parameters to the callback are strings that contain additional
** details about the action to be authorized.
**
** An authorizer is used when preparing SQL statements from an untrusted
** source, to ensure that the SQL statements do not try to access data
** that they are not allowed to see, or that they do not try to
** execute malicious statements that damage the database.  For

** not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the
** database.  An authorizer could then be put in place while the
** user-entered SQL is being prepared that disallows everything
** except SELECT statements.  
**
** Only a single authorizer can be in place on a database connection
** at a time.  Each call to sqlite3_set_authorizer overrides the

** interface is to keep a GUI updated during a large query.
**
** The progress callback is invoked once for every N virtual machine opcodes,

** To remove the progress callback altogether, pass NULL as the third

** CAPI3REF: Opening A New Database Connection
**
** Open the sqlite database file "filename".  The "filename" is UTF-8
** encoded for sqlite3_open() and UTF-16 encoded in the native byte order
** for sqlite3_open16().  An [sqlite3*] handle is returned in *ppDb, even
** if an error occurs. If the database is opened (or created) successfully,
** then [SQLITE_OK] is returned. Otherwise an error code is returned. The
** [sqlite3_errmsg()] or [sqlite3_errmsg16()]  routines can be used to obtain
** an English language description of the error.
**
** If the database file does not exist, then a new database will be created
** as needed.  The default encoding for the database will be UTF-8 if
** sqlite3_open() is called and UTF-16 if sqlite3_open16 is used.
**
** Whether or not an error occurs when it is opened, resources associated
** with the [sqlite3*] handle should be released by passing it to
** [sqlite3_close()] when it is no longer required.
**
** The sqlite3_open_v2() interface works like sqlite3_open() except that
** provides two additional parameters for additional control over the
** new database connection.  The flags parameter can be one of:
**
** <ol>
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]
** </ol>
**
** The first value opens the database read-only.  If the database does
** not previously exist, an error is returned.  The second option opens
** the database for reading and writing but the database must already
** exist or an error is returned.  The third option opens the database
** for reading and writing and creates it if it does not already exist.
** The third options is behavior that is used always for sqlite3_open()
** and sqlite3_open16().
**
** The fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is the name of the
** [sqlite3_vfs] object that defines the operating system 
** interface that the new database connection should use.  If the
** fourth parameter is a NULL pointer then a default suitable for
** the host environment is substituted.
**
** Note to windows users:  The encoding used for the filename argument
** of sqlite3_open() must be UTF-8, not whatever codepage is currently
** defined.  Filenames containing international characters must be converted
** to UTF-8 prior to passing them into sqlite3_open().

/*
** CAPI3REF: Compiling An SQL Statement
**
** To execute an SQL query, it must first be compiled into a byte-code
** program using one of these routines. 
**
** The first argument "db" is an [sqlite3 | SQLite database handle] 
** obtained from a prior call to [sqlite3_open()] or [sqlite3_open16()].
** The second argument "zSql" is the statement to be compiled, encoded
** as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare_v2()
** interfaces uses UTF-8 and sqlite3_prepare16() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2()
** use UTF-16.
**
** If the nByte argument is less
** than zero, then zSql is read up to the first zero terminator.  If
** nByte is non-negative, then it is the maximum number of 
** bytes read from zSql.  When nByte is non-negative, the
** zSql string ends at either the first '\000' character or 
** until the nByte-th byte, whichever comes first.
**
** *pzTail is made to point to the first byte past the end of the first
** SQL statement in zSql.  This routine only compiles the first statement
** in zSql, so *pzTail is left pointing to what remains uncompiled.
**
** *ppStmt is left pointing to a compiled 
** [sqlite3_stmt | SQL statement structure] that can be
** executed using [sqlite3_step()].  Or if there is an error, *ppStmt may be
** set to NULL.  If the input text contained no SQL (if the input is and
** empty string or a comment) then *ppStmt is set to NULL.  The calling
** procedure is responsible for deleting the compiled SQL statement
** using [sqlite3_finalize()] after it has finished with it.
**
** On success, [SQLITE_OK] is returned.  Otherwise an 
** [SQLITE_ERROR | error code] is returned.
**
** The sqlite3_prepare_v2() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2() interfaces are
** recommended for all new programs. The two older interfaces are retained
** for backwards compatibility, but their use is discouraged.
** In the "v2" interfaces, the prepared statement
** that is returned (the [sqlite3_stmt] object) contains a copy of the 
** original SQL text. This causes the [sqlite3_step()] interface to
** behave a differently in two ways:
**
** <ol>
** <li>
** If the database schema changes, instead of returning [SQLITE_SCHEMA] as it
** always used to do, [sqlite3_step()] will automatically recompile the SQL
** statement and try to run it again.  If the schema has changed in a way
** that makes the statement no longer valid, [sqlite3_step()] will still
** return [SQLITE_SCHEMA].  But unlike the legacy behavior, [SQLITE_SCHEMA] is
** now a fatal error.  Calling [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] again will not make the
** error go away.  Note: use [sqlite3_errmsg()] to find the text of the parsing
** error that results in an [SQLITE_SCHEMA] return.
** </li>
**
** <li>
** When an error occurs, 
** [sqlite3_step()] will return one of the detailed 
** [SQLITE_ERROR | result codes] or
** [SQLITE_IOERR_READ | extended result codes] such as directly.
** The legacy behavior was that [sqlite3_step()] would only return a generic
** [SQLITE_ERROR] result code and you would have to make a second call to
** [sqlite3_reset()] in order to find the underlying cause of the problem.
** With the "v2" prepare interfaces, the underlying reason for the error is
** returned immediately.

** <ul>
** <li>  ?
** <li>  ?NNN
** <li>  :AAA
** <li>  @AAA
** <li>  $VVV
** </ul>
**
** In the parameter forms shown above NNN is an integer literal,
** AAA is an alphanumeric identifier and VVV is a variable name according
** to the syntax rules of the TCL programming language.
** The values of these parameters (also called "host parameter names")
** can be set using the sqlite3_bind_*() routines defined here.
**
** The first argument to the sqlite3_bind_*() routines always is a pointer
** to the [sqlite3_stmt] object returned from [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or
** its variants.  The second
** argument is the index of the parameter to be set.  The first parameter has
** an index of 1. When the same named parameter is used more than once, second
** and subsequent
** occurrences have the same index as the first occurrence.  The index for
** named parameters can be looked up using the
** [sqlite3_bind_parameter_name()] API if desired.  The index for "?NNN"
** parametes is the value of NNN.
** The NNN value must be between 1 and the compile-time
** parameter SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER (default value: 999).
** See <a href="limits.html">limits.html</a> for additional information.
**
** The third argument is the value to bind to the parameter.
**
** In those
** routines that have a fourth argument, its value is the number of bytes
** in the parameter.  To be clear: the value is the number of bytes in the
** string, not the number of characters.  The number
** of bytes does not include the zero-terminator at the end of strings.
** If the fourth parameter is negative, the length of the string is
** number of bytes up to the first zero terminator.
**
** The fifth argument to sqlite3_bind_blob(), sqlite3_bind_text(), and
** sqlite3_bind_text16() is a destructor used to dispose of the BLOB or
** text after SQLite has finished with it.  If the fifth argument is the
** special value [SQLITE_STATIC], then the library assumes that the information
** is in static, unmanaged space and does not need to be freed.  If the
** fifth argument has the value [SQLITE_TRANSIENT], then SQLite makes its
** own private copy of the data immediately, before the sqlite3_bind_*()
** routine returns.
**
** The sqlite3_bind_zeroblob() routine binds a BLOB of length n that
** is filled with zeros.  A zeroblob uses a fixed amount of memory
** (just an integer to hold it size) while it is being processed.
** Zeroblobs are intended to serve as place-holders for BLOBs whose
** content is later written using 
** [sqlite3_blob_open | increment BLOB I/O] routines.
**
** The sqlite3_bind_*() routines must be called after
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] (and its variants) or [sqlite3_reset()] and
** before [sqlite3_step()].
** Bindings are not cleared by the [sqlite3_reset()] routine.
** Unbound parameters are interpreted as NULL.
**
** These routines return [SQLITE_OK] on success or an error code if

** index is out of range.  [SQLITE_NOMEM] is returned if malloc fails.
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] is returned if these routines are called on a virtual
** machine that is the wrong state or which has already been finalized.

** [SQLITE_DONE], [SQLITE_ROW], [SQLITE_ERROR], or [SQLITE_MISUSE].
** With the "v2" interface, any of the other [SQLITE_OK | result code]
** or [SQLITE_IOERR_READ | extended result code] might be returned as
** well.
**
** [SQLITE_BUSY] means that the database engine was unable to acquire the
** database locks it needs to do its job.  If the statement is a COMMIT
** or occurs outside of an explicit transaction, then you can retry the
** statement.  If the statement is not a COMMIT and occurs within a
** explicit transaction then you should rollback the transaction before
** continuing.
**
** [SQLITE_DONE] means that the statement has finished executing
** successfully.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on this virtual
** machine without first calling [sqlite3_reset()] to reset the virtual
** machine back to its initial state.
**
** If the SQL statement being executed returns any data, then 
** [SQLITE_ROW] is returned each time a new row of data is ready
** for processing by the caller. The values may be accessed using
** the [sqlite3_column_int | column access functions].
** sqlite3_step() is called again to retrieve the next row of data.
** 
** [SQLITE_ERROR] means that a run-time error (such as a constraint
** violation) has occurred.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on
** the VM. More information may be found by calling [sqlite3_errmsg()].
** With the legacy interface, a more specific error code (example:
** [SQLITE_INTERRUPT], [SQLITE_SCHEMA], [SQLITE_CORRUPT], and so forth)
** can be obtained by calling [sqlite3_reset()] on the
** [sqlite3_stmt | prepared statement].  In the "v2" interface,
** the more specific error code is returned directly by sqlite3_step().
**
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] means that the this routine was called inappropriately.
** Perhaps it was called on a [sqlite3_stmt | prepared statement] that has
** already been [sqlite3_finalize | finalized] or on one that had 
** previously returned [SQLITE_ERROR] or [SQLITE_DONE].  Or it could
** be the case that the same database connection is being used by two or
** more threads at the same moment in time.
**
** <b>Goofy Interface Alert:</b>
** In the legacy interface, 
** the sqlite3_step() API always returns a generic error code,
** [SQLITE_ERROR], following any error other than [SQLITE_BUSY]
** and [SQLITE_MISUSE].  You must call [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] in order to find one of the specific
** [SQLITE_ERROR | result codes] that better describes the error.
** We admit that this is a goofy design.  The problem has been fixed
** with the "v2" interface.  If you prepare all of your SQL statements
** using either [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] instead
** of the legacy [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()], then the 
** more specific [SQLITE_ERROR | result codes] are returned directly
** by sqlite3_step().  The use of the "v2" interface is recommended.

/*
** CAPI3REF: Results Values From A Query
**
** These routines return information about the information
** in a single column of the current result row of a query.  In every
** case the first argument is a pointer to the 
** [sqlite3_stmt | SQL statement] that is being
** evaluate (the [sqlite3_stmt*] that was returned from 
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or one of its variants) and
** the second argument is the index of the column for which information 
** should be returned.  The left-most column has an index of 0.
**
** If the SQL statement is not currently point to a valid row, or if the
** the column index is out of range, the result is undefined.
**
** The sqlite3_column_type() routine returns 
** [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype code] for the initial data type
** of the result column.  The returned value is one of [SQLITE_INTEGER],
** [SQLITE_FLOAT], [SQLITE_TEXT], [SQLITE_BLOB], or [SQLITE_NULL].  The value
** returned by sqlite3_column_type() is only meaningful if no type
** conversions have occurred as described below.  After a type conversion,
** the value returned by sqlite3_column_type() is undefined.  Future
** versions of SQLite may change the behavior of sqlite3_column_type()
** following a type conversion.
**
** If the result is a BLOB or UTF-8 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes() 
** routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
** If the result is a UTF-16 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes() converts
** the string to UTF-8 and then returns the number of bytes.
** If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes() uses
** [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-8 string and returns
** the number of bytes in that string.
** The value returned does not include the zero terminator at the end
** of the string.  For clarity: the value returned is the number of
** bytes in the string, not the number of characters.
**
** The sqlite3_column_bytes16() routine is similar to sqlite3_column_bytes()
** but leaves the result in UTF-16 instead of UTF-8.  
** The zero terminator is not included in this count.
**
** These routines attempt to convert the value where appropriate.  For
** example, if the internal representation is FLOAT and a text result
** is requested, [sqlite3_snprintf()] is used internally to do the conversion
** automatically.  The following table details the conversions that
** are applied:
**
** <blockquote>
** <table border="1">
** <tr><th> Internal <th> Requested <th> 
** <tr><th>  Type    <th>    Type   <th> Conversion
**
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td> INTEGER   <td> Result is 0
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Result is 0.0
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   TEXT    <td> Result is NULL pointer
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   BLOB    <td> Result is NULL pointer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>  FLOAT    <td> Convert from integer to float
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the integer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   BLOB    <td> Same as for INTEGER->TEXT
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td> INTEGER   <td> Convert from float to integer
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the float
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td>   BLOB    <td> Same as FLOAT->TEXT
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td> INTEGER   <td> Use atoi()
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Use atof()
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td>   BLOB    <td> No change
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td> INTEGER   <td> Convert to TEXT then use atoi()
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Convert to TEXT then use atof()
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td>   TEXT    <td> Add a zero terminator if needed
** </table>
** </blockquote>
**
** The table above makes reference to standard C library functions atoi()
** and atof().  SQLite does not really use these functions.  It has its
** on equavalent internal routines.  The atoi() and atof() names are
** used in the table for brevity and because they are familiar to most
** C programmers.
**
** Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior
** calls to sqlite3_column_blob(), sqlite3_column_text(), and/or
** sqlite3_column_text16() may be invalidated. 
** Type conversions and pointer invalidations might occur
** in the following cases:
**
** <ul>
** <li><p>  The initial content is a BLOB and sqlite3_column_text() 
**          or sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  A zero-terminator might
**          need to be added to the string.</p></li>
**
** <li><p>  The initial content is UTF-8 text and sqlite3_column_bytes16() or
**          sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  The content must be converted
**          to UTF-16.</p></li>
**
** <li><p>  The initial content is UTF-16 text and sqlite3_column_bytes() or
**          sqlite3_column_text() is called.  The content must be converted
**          to UTF-8.</p></li>
** </ul>
**
** Conversions between UTF-16be and UTF-16le are always done in place and do
** not invalidate a prior pointer, though of course the content of the buffer
** that the prior pointer points to will have been modified.  Other kinds
** of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometime it is
** not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.  
**
** The safest and easiest to remember policy is to invoke these routines
** in one of the following ways:
**
**  <ul>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_blob() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text16() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes16()</li>
**  </ul>
**
** In other words, you should call sqlite3_column_text(), sqlite3_column_blob(),
** or sqlite3_column_text16() first to force the result into the desired
** format, then invoke sqlite3_column_bytes() or sqlite3_column_bytes16() to
** find the size of the result.  Do not mix call to sqlite3_column_text() or
** sqlite3_column_blob() with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes16().  And do not
** mix calls to sqlite3_column_text16() with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes().

** difference only between the two is that the second parameter, the
** name of the (scalar) function or aggregate, is encoded in UTF-8 for
** sqlite3_create_function() and UTF-16 for sqlite3_create_function16().
**
** The first argument is the [sqlite3 | database handle] that holds the
** SQL function or aggregate is to be added or redefined. If a single
** program uses more than one database handle internally, then SQL
** functions or aggregates must be added individually to each database
** handle with which they will be used.
**
** The second parameter is the name of the SQL function to be created
** or redefined.
** The length of the name is limited to 255 bytes, exclusive of the 
** zero-terminator.  Note that the name length limit is in bytes, not
** characters.  Any attempt to create a function with a longer name
** will result in an SQLITE_ERROR error.
**
** The third parameter is the number of arguments that the SQL function or
** aggregate takes. If this parameter is negative, then the SQL function or
** aggregate may take any number of arguments.
**
** The fourth parameter, eTextRep, specifies what 
** [SQLITE_UTF8 | text encoding] this SQL function prefers for
** its parameters.  Any SQL function implementation should be able to work
** work with UTF-8, UTF-16le, or UTF-16be.  But some implementations may be
** more efficient with one encoding than another.  It is allowed to
** invoke sqlite3_create_function() or sqlite3_create_function16() multiple
** times with the same function but with different values of eTextRep.
** When multiple implementations of the same function are available, SQLite
** will pick the one that involves the least amount of data conversion.
** If there is only a single implementation which does not care what
** text encoding is used, then the fourth argument should be
** [SQLITE_ANY].
**
** The fifth parameter is an arbitrary pointer.  The implementation
** of the function can gain access to this pointer using
** [sqlite3_user_data()].
**
** The seventh, eighth and ninth parameters, xFunc, xStep and xFinal, are
** pointers to C-language functions that implement the SQL
** function or aggregate. A scalar SQL function requires an implementation of
** the xFunc callback only, NULL pointers should be passed as the xStep
** and xFinal parameters. An aggregate SQL function requires an implementation
** of xStep and xFinal and NULL should be passed for xFunc. To delete an
** existing SQL function or aggregate, pass NULL for all three function
** callback.
**
** It is permitted to register multiple implementations of the same
** functions with the same name but with either differing numbers of
** arguments or differing perferred text encodings.  SQLite will use
** the implementation most closely matches the way in which the

** to [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]

** these routines take a single [sqlite3_value*] pointer instead
** of an [sqlite3_stmt*] pointer and an integer column number.
**
** The sqlite3_value_text16() interface extracts a UTF16 string
** in the native byte-order of the host machine.  The
** sqlite3_value_text16be() and sqlite3_value_text16le() interfaces
** extract UTF16 strings as big-endian and little-endian respectively.

**
** A pointer to the user supplied routine must be passed as the fifth

** function replaces any existing callback.
**
** When the callback is invoked, the first argument passed is a copy
** of the second argument to sqlite3_collation_needed() or

** handle. The third argument is one of [SQLITE_UTF8], [SQLITE_UTF16BE], or

** VFS is returned.
**
** New VFSes are registered with sqlite3_register_vfs().  Each
** new VFS becomes the default VFS if the makeDflt flag is set.
** The same VFS can be registered multiple times without injury.
** To make an existing VFS into the default VFS, register it again
** with the makeDflt flag set.

/*
** CAPI3REF: Mutexes
**
** The SQLite core uses these routines for thread
** synchronization.  Though they are intended for internal
** use by SQLite, code that links against SQLite is
** permitted to use any of these routines.
**
** The SQLite source code contains multiple implementations 
** of these mutex routines that can be selected at compile-time
** by defining one of the following C preprocessor macros:
**
** <ul>
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREAD
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_WIN32
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF
** </ul>
**
** If none of the above macros is defined, the code uses
** a default implementation.  
** 
** The SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP implementation is a set of routines 
** that does no real locking and is appropriate for use in 
** a single-threaded application.
** 
** If the SQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF is defined, then no mutex
** implementation is included with the library.  The
** mutex interface routines defined above are external
** references in the SQLite library for which implementations
** must be provided by the application.
**
** The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
** mutex and returns a pointer to it.  If it returns NULL
** that means that a mutex could not be allocated.  SQLite
** will unwind its stack and return an error.  The argument
** to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() is usually zero, which causes
** any space required for the mutex to be obtained from
** sqlite3_malloc().  However if the argument is a positive
** integer less than or equal to SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MAX, then a pointer
** to a static mutex is returned.  There are a finite number
** of static mutexes.  Static mutexes should not be passed
** to sqlite3_mutex_free().  Static mutexes are used internally
** by the SQLite core and should not be used by the application.
**
** The sqlite3_mutex_free() routine deallocates a previously
** allocated mutex.  SQLite is careful to deallocate every
** mutex that it allocates.
**
** The sqlite3_mutex_enter() routine attempts to enter a
** mutex.  If another thread is already within the mutex,
** sqlite3_mutex_enter() will return SQLITE_BUSY if blockFlag
** is zero, or it will block and wait for the other thread to
** exit if blockFlag is non-zero.  Mutexes are recursive.  The
** same thread can enter a single mutex multiple times.  Each
** entrance must be matched with a corresponding exit before
** another thread is able to enter the mutex.
**
** The sqlite3_mutex_exit() routine exits a mutex that was
** previously entered by the same thread.  The behavior
** is undefined if the mutex is not currently entered or
** is not currently allocated.  SQLite will never do either.
**
** The sqlite3_mutex_serialize() routine is used to serialize 
** a subroutine.  The subroutine given in the argument is invoked
** while holding a static mutex.  This ensures that no other
** thread is running this same subroutine at the same time.
